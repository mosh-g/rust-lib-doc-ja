The following example shows a struct with a C representation. #[repr(C)]\nstruct ThreeInts { first: i16, second: i8, third: i32\n} Note: As a consequence of the representation being an attribute on the item, the representation does not depend on generic parameters. Any two types with the same name have the same representation. For example, Foo<Bar> and Foo<Baz> both have the same representation.

SHEBANG? InnerAttribute * Item * Lexer UTF8BOM : \\uFEFF SHEBANG : #! ~[ [ \\n ] ~ \\n * Note: Although Rust, like any other language, can be implemented by an interpreter as well as a compiler, the only existing implementation is a compiler,and the language has always been designed to be compiled. For these reasons, this section assumes a compiler. Rust's semantics obey a phase distinction between compile-time and run-time. [1] Semantic rules that have a static interpretation govern the success or failure of compilation, while semantic rules that have a dynamic interpretation govern the behavior of the program at run-time. The compilation model centers on artifacts called crates . Each compilation processes a single crate in source form, and if successful, produces a single crate in binary form: either an executable or some sort of library. [2] A crate is a unit of compilation and linking, as well as versioning, distribution and runtime loading. A crate contains a tree of nested module scopes. The top level of this tree is a module that is anonymous (from the point of view of paths within the module) and any item within a crate has a canonical module path denoting its location within the crate's module tree. The Rust compiler is always invoked with a single source file as input, and always produces a single output crate. The processing of that source file may result in other source files being loaded as modules. Source files have the extension .rs . A Rust source file describes a module, the name and location of which — in the module tree of the current crate — are defined from outside the source file: either by an explicit mod_item in a referencing source file, or by the name of the crate itself. Every source file is a module, but not every module needs its own source file: module definitions can be nested within one file. Each source file contains a sequence of zero or more item definitions, and may optionally begin with any number of attributes that apply to the containing module, most of which influence the behavior of the compiler. The anonymous crate module can have additional attributes that apply to the crate as a whole. // Specify the crate name.\n#![crate_name = \"projx\"] // Specify the type of output artifact.\n#![crate_type = \"lib\"] // Turn on a warning.\n// This can be done in any module, not just the anonymous crate module.\n#![warn(non_camel_case_types)] A crate that contains a main function can be compiled to an executable. If a main function is present, it must take no arguments, must not declare any trait or lifetime bounds , must not have any [where clauses], and its return type must be one of the following: () * `Result where T: on this list, E: Error` Note: The implementation of which return types are allowed is determined by the unstable Termination trait. The optional UTF8 byte order mark (UTF8BOM production) indicates that the file is encoded in UTF8. It can only occur at the beginning of the file and is ignored by the compiler. A source file can have a shebang (SHEBANG production), which indicates to the operating system what program to use to execute this file. It serves essentially to treat the source file as an executable script. The shebang can only occur at the beginning of the file (but after the optional UTF8BOM ). It is ignored by the compiler. For example: #!/usr/bin/env rustx fn main() { println!(\"Hello!\");\n} This distinction would also exist in an interpreter. Static checks like syntactic analysis, type checking, and lints should happen before the program is executed regardless of when it is executed. A crate is somewhat analogous to an assembly in the ECMA-335 CLI model, a library in the SML/NJ Compilation Manager, a unit in the Owens and Flatt module system, or a configuration in Mesa.","breadcrumbs":"Crates and source files","title":"Crates and source files"},"macros.html#macros":{"id":"macros.html#macros","title":"Macros","body":"A number of minor features of Rust are not central enough to have their own syntax, and yet are not implementable as functions.

WhereClause ? { StructFields } A union declaration uses the same syntax as a struct declaration, except with union in place of struct . #[repr(C)]\nunion MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32,\n} The key property of unions is that all fields of a union share common storage. As a result writes to one field of a union can overwrite its other fields, and size of a union is determined by the size of its largest field. A value of a union type can be created using the same syntax that is used for struct types, except that it must specify exactly one field: # union MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32 }\n#\nlet u = MyUnion { f1: 1 }; The expression above creates a value of type MyUnion with active field f1 . Active field of a union can be accessed using the same syntax as struct fields: let f = u.f1; Inactive fields can be accessed as well (using the same syntax) if they are sufficiently layout compatible with the current value kept by the union. Reading incompatible fields results in undefined behavior. However, the active field is not generally known statically, so all reads of union fields have to be placed in unsafe blocks. # union MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32 }\n# let u = MyUnion { f1: 1 };\n#\nunsafe { let f = u.f1;\n} Writes to Copy union fields do not require reads for running destructors, so these writes don't have to be placed in unsafe blocks # union MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32 }\n# let mut u = MyUnion { f1: 1 };\n#\nu.f1 = 2; Commonly, code using unions will provide safe wrappers around unsafe union field accesses. Another way to access union fields is to use pattern matching. Pattern matching on union fields uses the same syntax as struct patterns, except that the pattern must specify exactly one field. Since pattern matching accesses potentially inactive fields it has to be placed in unsafe blocks as well. # union MyUnion { f1: u32, f2: f32 }\n#\nfn f(u: MyUnion) { unsafe { match u { MyUnion { f1: 10 } => { println!(\"ten\"); } MyUnion { f2 } => { println!(\"{}\", f2); } } }\n} Pattern matching may match a union as a field of a larger structure. In particular, when using a Rust union to implement a C tagged union via FFI, this allows matching on the tag and the corresponding field simultaneously: #[repr(u32)]\nenum Tag { I, F } #[repr(C)]\nunion U { i: i32, f: f32,\n} #[repr(C)]\nstruct Value { tag: Tag, u: U,\n} fn is_zero(v: Value) -> bool { unsafe { match v { Value { tag: I, u: U { i: 0 } } => true, Value { tag: F, u: U { f: 0.0 } } => true, _ => false, } }\n} Since union fields share common storage, gaining write access to one field of a union can give write access to all its remaining fields. Borrow checking rules have to be adjusted to account for this fact. As a result, if one field of a union is borrowed, all its remaining fields are borrowed as well for the same lifetime. // ERROR: cannot borrow `u` (via `u.f2`) as mutable more than once at a time\nfn test() { let mut u = MyUnion { f1: 1 }; unsafe { let b1 = &mut u.f1; ---- first mutable borrow occurs here (via `u.f1`) let b2 = &mut u.f2; ^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here (via `u.f2`) *b1 = 5; } - first borrow ends here assert_eq!(unsafe { u.f1 }, 5);\n} As you could see, in many aspects (except for layouts, safety and ownership) unions behave exactly like structs, largely as a consequence of inheriting their syntactic shape from structs. This is also true for many unmentioned aspects of Rust language (such as privacy, name resolution, type inference, generics, trait implementations, inherent implementations, coherence, pattern checking, etc etc etc).

Usually a use declaration is used to shorten the path required to refer to a module item. These declarations may appear in modules and blocks , usually at the top. Note : Unlike in many languages, use declarations in Rust do not declare linkage dependency with external crates. Rather, extern crate declarations declare linkage dependencies. Use declarations support a number of convenient shortcuts: Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix, using the glob-like brace syntax use a::b::{c, d, e::f, g::h::i}; Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix and their common parent module, using the self keyword, such as use a::b::{self, c, d::e}; Rebinding the target name as a new local name, using the syntax use p::q::r as x; . This can also be used with the last two features: use a::b::{self as ab, c as abc} . Binding all paths matching a given prefix, using the asterisk wildcard syntax use a::b::*; . Nesting groups of the previous features multiple times, such as use a::b::{self as ab, c, d::{*, e::f}}; An example of use declarations: use std::option::Option::{Some, None};\nuse std::collections::hash_map::{self, HashMap}; fn foo<T>(_: T){}\nfn bar(map1: HashMap<String, usize>, map2: hash_map::HashMap<String, usize>){} fn main() { // Equivalent to 'foo(vec![std::option::Option::Some(1.0f64), // std::option::Option::None]);' foo(vec![Some(1.0f64), None]); // Both `hash_map` and `HashMap` are in scope. let map1 = HashMap::new(); let map2 = hash_map::HashMap::new(); bar(map1, map2);\n} Like items, use declarations are private to the containing module, by default. Also like items, a use declaration can be public, if qualified by the pub keyword. Such a use declaration serves to re-export a name. A public use declaration can therefore redirect some public name to a different target definition: even a definition with a private canonical path, inside a different module. If a sequence of such redirections form a cycle or cannot be resolved unambiguously, they represent a compile-time error. An example of re-exporting: # fn main() { }\nmod quux { pub use quux::foo::{bar, baz}; pub mod foo { pub fn bar() { } pub fn baz() { } }\n} In this example, the module quux re-exports two public names defined in foo . Also note that the paths contained in use items are relative to the crate root. So, in the previous example, the use refers to quux::foo::{bar, baz} , and not simply to foo::{bar, baz} . This also means that top-level module declarations should be at the crate root if direct usage of the declared modules within use items is desired. It is also possible to use self and super at the beginning of a use item to refer to the current and direct parent modules respectively. All rules regarding accessing declared modules in use declarations apply to both module declarations and extern crate declarations. An example of what will and will not work for use items: # #![allow(unused_imports)]\nuse foo::baz::foobaz; // good: foo is at the root of the crate mod foo { mod example { pub mod iter {} } use foo::example::iter; // good: foo is at crate root\n// use example::iter; // bad: example is not at the crate root use self::baz::foobaz; // good: self refers to module 'foo' use foo::bar::foobar; // good: foo is at crate root pub mod bar { pub fn foobar() { } } pub mod baz { use super::bar::foobar; // good: super refers to module 'foo' pub fn foobaz() { } }\n} fn main() {}","breadcrumbs":"Items and attributes » Items » Use declarations","id":"items/use-declarations.html#use-declarations"},"glossary.html#nominal-types":{"body":"Types that can be referred to by a path directly.

It will pick the first choice of these that allows the closure to compile. The choice is made only with regards to the contents of the closure expression; the compiler does not take into account surrounding code, such as the lifetimes of involved variables. If the move keyword is used, then all captures are by move or, for Copy types, by copy, regardless of whether a borrow would work. The move keyword is usually used to allow the closure to outlive the captured values, such as if the closure is being returned or used to spawn a new thread. Composite types such as structs, tuples, and enums are always captured entirely, not by individual fields. It may be necessary to borrow into a local variable in order to capture a single field: # use std::collections::HashSet;\n# struct SetVec { set: HashSet<u32>, vec: Vec<u32>\n} impl SetVec { fn populate(&mut self) { let vec = &mut self.vec; self.set.iter().for_each(|&n| { vec.push(n); }) }\n} If, instead, the closure were to use self.vec directly, then it would attempt to capture self by mutable reference.

This is different from other library outputs in that the Rust compiler will never attempt to link to staticlib outputs. The purpose of this output type is to create a static library containing all of the local crate's code along with all upstream dependencies. The static library is actually a *.a archive on linux and osx and a *.lib file on windows. This format is recommended for use in situations such as linking Rust code into an existing non-Rust application because it will not have dynamic dependencies on other Rust code. --crate-type=cdylib , #[crate_type = \"cdylib\"] - A dynamic system library will be produced. This is used when compiling Rust code as a dynamic library to be loaded from another language. This output type will create *.so files on Linux, *.dylib files on macOS, and *.dll files on Windows. --crate-type=rlib , #[crate_type = \"rlib\"] - A \"Rust library\" file will be produced. This is used as an intermediate artifact and can be thought of as a \"static Rust library\". These rlib files, unlike staticlib files, are interpreted by the Rust compiler in future linkage. This essentially means that rustc will look for metadata in rlib files like it looks for metadata in dynamic libraries. This form of output is used to produce statically linked executables as well as staticlib outputs. --crate-type=proc-macro , #[crate_type = \"proc-macro\"] - The output produced is not specified, but if a -L path is provided to it then the compiler will recognize the output artifacts as a macro and it can be loaded for a program. If a crate is compiled with the proc-macro crate type it will forbid exporting any items in the crate other than those functions tagged #[proc_macro_derive] and those functions must also be placed at the crate root. Finally, the compiler will automatically set the cfg(proc_macro) annotation whenever any crate type of a compilation is the proc-macro crate type. Note that these outputs are stackable in the sense that if multiple are specified, then the compiler will produce each form of output at once without having to recompile. However, this only applies for outputs specified by the same method. If only crate_type attributes are specified, then they will all be built, but if one or more --crate-type command line flags are specified, then only those outputs will be built. With all these different kinds of outputs, if crate A depends on crate B, then the compiler could find B in various different forms throughout the system. The only forms looked for by the compiler, however, are the rlib format and the dynamic library format. With these two options for a dependent library, the compiler must at some point make a choice between these two formats. With this in mind, the compiler follows these rules when determining what format of dependencies will be used: If a static library is being produced, all upstream dependencies are required to be available in rlib formats. This requirement stems from the reason that a dynamic library cannot be converted into a static format. Note that it is impossible to link in native dynamic dependencies to a static library, and in this case warnings will be printed about all unlinked native dynamic dependencies. If an rlib file is being produced, then there are no restrictions on what format the upstream dependencies are available in. It is simply required that all upstream dependencies be available for reading metadata from. The reason for this is that rlib files do not contain any of their upstream dependencies. It wouldn't be very efficient for all rlib files to contain a copy of libstd.rlib ! If an executable is being produced and the -C prefer-dynamic flag is not specified, then dependencies are first attempted to be found in the rlib format. If some dependencies are not available in an rlib format, then dynamic linking is attempted (see below). If a dynamic library or an executable that is being dynamically linked is being produced, then the compiler will attempt to reconcile the available dependencies in either the rlib or dylib format to create a final product. A major goal of the compiler is to ensure that a library never appears more than once in any artifact. For example, if dynamic libraries B and C were each statically linked to library A, then a crate could not link to B and C together because there would be two copies of A. The compiler allows mixing the rlib and dylib formats, but this restriction must be satisfied. The compiler currently implements no method of hinting what format a library should be linked with. When dynamically linking, the compiler will attempt to maximize dynamic dependencies while still allowing some dependencies to be linked in via an rlib. For most situations, having all libraries available as a dylib is recommended if dynamically linking. For other situations, the compiler will emit a warning if it is unable to determine which formats to link each library with. In general, --crate-type=bin or --crate-type=lib should be sufficient for all compilation needs, and the other options are just available if more fine-grained control is desired over the output format of a Rust crate."},"expressions/array-expr.html#array-expressions":{"title":"Array expressions","breadcrumbs":"Statements and expressions » Expressions » Array expressions","body":"Syntax ArrayExpression : [ ] | [ Expression ( , Expression )* , ? ] | [ Expression ; Expression ] An array expression can be written by enclosing zero or more comma-separated expressions of uniform type in square brackets.

One purpose is for creating types that are interoptable with the C Language. The second purpose is to create types that you can soundly performing operations that rely on data layout such as reinterpreting values as a different type. Because of this dual purpose, it is possible to create types that are not useful for interfacing with the C programming language. This representation can be applied to structs, unions, and enums. #[repr(C)] Structs The alignment of the struct is the alignment of the most-aligned field in it. The size and offset of fields is determined by the following algorithm. Start with a current offset of 0 bytes. For each field in declaration order in the struct, first determine the size and alignment of the field. If the current offset is not a multiple of the field's alignment, then add padding bytes to the current offset until it is a multiple of the field's alignment. The offset for the field is what the current offset is now. Then increase the current offset by the size of the field. Finally, the size of the struct is the current offset rounded up to the nearest multiple of the struct's alignment. Here is this algorithm described in pseudocode. struct.alignment = struct.fields().map(|field| field.alignment).max(); let current_offset = 0; for field in struct.fields_in_declaration_order() { // Increase the current offset so that it's a multiple of the alignment // of this field. For the first field, this will always be zero. // The skipped bytes are called padding bytes. current_offset += field.alignment % current_offset; struct[field].offset = current_offset; current_offset += field.size;\n} struct.size = current_offset + current_offset % struct.alignment; Note: This algorithm can produce zero-sized structs. This differs from C where structs without data still have a size of one byte. #[repr(C)] Unions A union declared with #[repr(C)] will have the same size and alignment as an equivalent C union declaration in the C language for the target platform. The union will have a size of the maximum size of all of its fields rounded to its alignment, and an alignment of the maximum alignment of all of its fields. These maximums may come from different fields. #[repr(C)]\nunion Union { f1: u16, f2: [u8; 4],\n} assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Union>(), 4); // From f2\nassert_eq!(std::mem::align_of::<Union>(), 2); // From f1 #[repr(C)]\nunion SizeRoundedUp { a: u32, b: [u16; 3],\n} assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<SizeRoundedUp>(), 8); // Size of 6 from b, // rounded up to 8 from // alignment of a.\nassert_eq!(std::mem::align_of::<SizeRoundedUp>(), 4); // From a #[repr(C)] Enums For C-like enumerations , the C representation has the size and alignment of the default enum size and alignment for the target platform's C ABI. Note: The enum representation in C is implementation defined, so this is really a \"best guess\". In particular, this may be incorrect when the C code of interest is compiled with certain flags. Warning: There are crucial differences between an enum in the C language and Rust's C-like enumerations with this representation. An enum in C is mostly a typedef plus some named constants; in other words, an object of an enum type can hold any integer value. For example, this is often used for bitflags in C . In contrast, Rust’s C-like enumerations can only legally hold the discriminant values, everything else is undefined behaviour. Therefore, using a C-like enumeration in FFI to model a C enum is often wrong. It is an error for zero-variant enumerations to have the C representation. For all other enumerations, the layout is unspecified.

When referred to, a function yields a first-class value of the corresponding zero-sized function item type , which when called evaluates to a direct call to the function. For example, this is a simple function: fn answer_to_life_the_universe_and_everything() -> i32 { return 42;\n} As with let bindings, function arguments are irrefutable patterns, so any pattern that is valid in a let binding is also valid as an argument: fn first((value, _): (i32, i32)) -> i32 { value } The block of a function is conceptually wrapped in a block that binds the argument patterns and then return s the value of the function's block. This means that the tail expression of the block, if evaluated, ends up being returned to the caller. As usual, an explicit return expression within the body of the function will short-cut that implicit return, if reached. For example, the function above behaves as if it was written as: // argument_0 is the actual first argument passed from the caller\nlet (value, _) = argument_0;\nreturn { value\n};"},"types.html#enumerated-types":{"id":"types.html#enumerated-types","breadcrumbs":"Type system » Enumerated types","body":"An enumerated type is a nominal, heterogeneous disjoint union type, denoted by the name of an enum item .

Functions within external blocks may be called by Rust code, just like functions defined in Rust. The Rust compiler automatically translates between the Rust ABI and the foreign ABI. Functions within external blocks may be variadic by specifying ... after one or more named arguments in the argument list: extern { fn foo(x: i32, ...);\n} A number of attributes control the behavior of external blocks.

Other kinds of builds may result in panics or silently wrapped values on overflow, at the implementation's discretion. In the case of implicitly-wrapped overflow, implementations must provide well-defined (even if still considered erroneous) results by using two's complement overflow conventions.

( || | | FunctionParameters ? | ) ( Expression | -> TypeNoBounds BlockExpression ) A closure expression defines a closure and denotes it as a value, in a single expression. A closure expression is a pipe-symbol-delimited ( | ) list of patterns followed by an expression. Type annotations may optionally be added for the type of the parameters or for the return type. If there is a return type, the expression used for the body of the closure must be a normal block . A closure expression also may begin with the move keyword before the initial | . A closure expression denotes a function that maps a list of parameters ( ident_list ) onto the expression that follows the ident_list . The patterns in the ident_list are the parameters to the closure. If a parameter's types is not specified, then the compiler infers it from context. Each closure expression has a unique anonymous type. Closure expressions are most useful when passing functions as arguments to other functions, as an abbreviation for defining and capturing a separate function. Significantly, closure expressions capture their environment , which regular function definitions do not. Without the move keyword, the closure expression infers how it captures each variable from its environment, preferring to capture by shared reference, effectively borrowing all outer variables mentioned inside the closure's body. If needed the compiler will infer that instead mutable references should be taken, or that the values should be moved or copied (depending on their type) from the environment. A closure can be forced to capture its environment by copying or moving values by prefixing it with the move keyword. This is often used to ensure that the closure's type is 'static . The compiler will determine which of the closure traits the closure's type will implement by how it acts on its captured variables. The closure will also implement Send and/or Sync if all of its captured types do. These traits allow functions to accept closures using generics, even though the exact types can't be named. In this example, we define a function ten_times that takes a higher-order function argument, and we then call it with a closure expression as an argument, followed by a closure expression that moves values from its environment. fn ten_times<F>(f: F) where F: Fn(i32) { for index in 0..10 { f(index); }\n} ten_times(|j| println!(\"hello, {}\", j));\n// With type annotations\nten_times(|j: i32| -> () { println!(\"hello, {}\", j) }); let word = \"konnichiwa\".to_owned();\nten_times(move |j| println!(\"{}, {}\", word, j));","id":"expressions/closure-expr.html#closure-expressions"},"glossary.html#associated-item":{"id":"glossary.html#associated-item","body":"An associated item is an item that is associated with another item.

Auto traits have special properties. If no explicit implementation or negative implementation is written out for an auto trait for a given type, then the compiler implements it automatically according to the following rules: &T , &mut T , *const T , *mut T , [T; n] and [T] implement the trait if T does. Function item types and function pointers automatically implement the trait. Structs, enums, unions and tuples implement the trait if all of their fields do. Closures implement the trait if the types of all of their captures do. A closure that captures a T by shared reference and a U by value implements any auto traits that both &T and U do. For generic types (counting the built-in types above as generic over T ), if an generic implementation is available, then the compiler does not automatically implement it for types that could use the implementation except that they do not meet the requisite trait bounds. For instance, the standard library implements Send for all &T where T is Sync ; this means that the compiler will not implement Send for &T if T is Send but not Sync . Auto traits can also have negative implementations, shown as impl !AutoTrait for T in the standard library documentation, that override the automatic implementations. For example *mut T has a negative implementation of Send , and so *mut T is not Send , even if T is. There is currently no stable way to specify additional negative implementations; they exist only in the standard library.

Note : In the past, the Rust community used the terms \"Unambiguous Function Call Syntax\", \"Universal Function Call Syntax\", or \"UFCS\", in documentation, issues, RFCs, and other community writings. However, the term lacks descriptive power and potentially confuses the issue at hand. We mention it here for searchability's sake. Several situations often occur which result in ambiguities about the receiver or referent of method or associated function calls. These situations may include: Multiple in-scope traits define methods with the same name for the same types Auto- deref is undesirable; for example, distinguishing between methods on a smart pointer itself and the pointer's referent Methods which take no arguments, like default() , and return properties of a type, like size_of() To resolve the ambiguity, the programmer may refer to their desired method or function using more specific paths, types, or traits. For example, trait Pretty { fn print(&self);\n} trait Ugly { fn print(&self);\n} struct Foo;\nimpl Pretty for Foo { fn print(&self) {}\n} struct Bar;\nimpl Pretty for Bar { fn print(&self) {}\n}\nimpl Ugly for Bar{ fn print(&self) {}\n} fn main() { let f = Foo; let b = Bar; // we can do this because we only have one item called `print` for `Foo`s f.print(); // more explicit, and, in the case of `Foo`, not necessary Foo::print(&f); // if you're not into the whole brevity thing <Foo as Pretty>::print(&f); // b.print(); // Error: multiple 'print' found // Bar::print(&b); // Still an error: multiple `print` found // necessary because of in-scope items defining `print` <Bar as Pretty>::print(&b);\n} Refer to RFC 132 for further details and motivations.","id":"expressions/call-expr.html#disambiguating-function-calls"},"items.html#items":{"title":"Items","body":"An item is a component of a crate.

Each level in the hierarchy can be thought of as some item. The items are one of those mentioned above, but also include external crates. Declaring or defining a new module can be thought of as inserting a new tree into the hierarchy at the location of the definition. To control whether interfaces can be used across modules, Rust checks each use of an item to see whether it should be allowed or not. This is where privacy warnings are generated, or otherwise \"you used a private item of another module and weren't allowed to.\" By default, everything in Rust is private , with two exceptions: Associated items in a pub Trait are public by default; Enum variants in a pub enum are also public by default. When an item is declared as pub , it can be thought of as being accessible to the outside world. For example: # fn main() {}\n// Declare a private struct\nstruct Foo; // Declare a public struct with a private field\npub struct Bar { field: i32,\n} // Declare a public enum with two public variants\npub enum State { PubliclyAccessibleState, PubliclyAccessibleState2,\n} With the notion of an item being either public or private, Rust allows item accesses in two cases: If an item is public, then it can be accessed externally from some module m if you can access all the item's parent modules from m . You can also potentially be able to name the item through re-exports. See below. If an item is private, it may be accessed by the current module and its descendants. These two cases are surprisingly powerful for creating module hierarchies exposing public APIs while hiding internal implementation details. To help explain, here's a few use cases and what they would entail: A library developer needs to expose functionality to crates which link against their library. As a consequence of the first case, this means that anything which is usable externally must be pub from the root down to the destination item. Any private item in the chain will disallow external accesses. A crate needs a global available \"helper module\" to itself, but it doesn't want to expose the helper module as a public API. To accomplish this, the root of the crate's hierarchy would have a private module which then internally has a \"public API\". Because the entire crate is a descendant of the root, then the entire local crate can access this private module through the second case. When writing unit tests for a module, it's often a common idiom to have an immediate child of the module to-be-tested named mod test . This module could access any items of the parent module through the second case, meaning that internal implementation details could also be seamlessly tested from the child module. In the second case, it mentions that a private item \"can be accessed\" by the current module and its descendants, but the exact meaning of accessing an item depends on what the item is. Accessing a module, for example, would mean looking inside of it (to import more items). On the other hand, accessing a function would mean that it is invoked. Additionally, path expressions and import statements are considered to access an item in the sense that the import/expression is only valid if the destination is in the current visibility scope. Here's an example of a program which exemplifies the three cases outlined above: // This module is private, meaning that no external crate can access this\n// module. Because it is private at the root of this current crate, however, any\n// module in the crate may access any publicly visible item in this module.\nmod crate_helper_module { // This function can be used by anything in the current crate pub fn crate_helper() {} // This function *cannot* be used by anything else in the crate. It is not // publicly visible outside of the `crate_helper_module`, so only this // current module and its descendants may access it. fn implementation_detail() {}\n} // This function is \"public to the root\" meaning that it's available to external\n// crates linking against this one.\npub fn public_api() {} // Similarly to 'public_api', this module is public so external crates may look\n// inside of it.\npub mod submodule { use crate_helper_module; pub fn my_method() { // Any item in the local crate may invoke the helper module's public // interface through a combination of the two rules above. crate_helper_module::crate_helper(); } // This function is hidden to any module which is not a descendant of // `submodule` fn my_implementation() {} #[cfg(test)] mod test { #[test] fn test_my_implementation() { // Because this module is a descendant of `submodule`, it's allowed // to access private items inside of `submodule` without a privacy // violation. super::my_implementation(); } }\n} # fn main() {} For a Rust program to pass the privacy checking pass, all paths must be valid accesses given the two rules above.

This requires a more complex lookup process than for other functions, since there may be a number of possible methods to call. The following procedure is used: The first step is to build a list of candidate receiver types. Obtain these by repeatedly dereferencing the receiver expression's type, adding each type encountered to the list, then finally attempting an [unsized coercion] at the end, and adding the result type if that is successful. Then, for each candidate T , add &T and &mut T to the list immediately after T . For instance, if the receiver has type Box<[i32;2]> , then the candidate types will be Box<[i32;2]> , &Box<[i32;2]> , &mut Box<[i32;2]> , [i32; 2] (by dereferencing), &[i32; 2] , &mut [i32; 2] , [i32] (by unsized coercion), &[i32] , and finally &mut [i32] . Then, for each candidate type T , search for a visible method with a receiver of that type in the following places: T 's inherent methods (methods implemented directly on T ). Any of the methods provided by a visible trait implemented by T . If T is a type parameter, methods provided by trait bounds on T are looked up first. Then all remaining methods in scope are looked up. Note: the lookup is done for each type in order, which can occasionally lead to surprising results. The below code will print \"In trait impl!\", because &self methods are looked up first, the trait method is found before the struct's &mut self method is found. struct Foo {} trait Bar { fn bar(&self);\n} impl Foo { fn bar(&mut self) { println!(\"In struct impl!\") }\n} impl Bar for Foo { fn bar(&self) { println!(\"In trait impl!\") }\n} fn main() { let mut f = Foo{}; f.bar();\n} If this results in multiple possible candidates, then it is an error, and the receiver must be converted to an appropriate receiver type to make the method call. This process does not take into account the mutability or lifetime of the receiver, or whether a method is unsafe . Once a method is looked up, if it can't be called for one (or more) of those reasons, the result is a compiler error. If a step is reached where there is more than one possible method, such as where generic methods or traits are considered the same, then it is a compiler error. These cases require a disambiguating function call syntax for method and function invocation. Warning: For trait objects , if there is an inherent method of the same name as a trait method, it will give a compiler error when trying to call the method in a method call expression. Instead, you can call the method using disambiguating function call syntax , in which case it calls the trait method, not the inherent method. There is no way to call the inherent method.

TypeParamBounds A trait object is an opaque value of another type that implements a set of traits. The set of traits is made up of an object safe base trait plus any number of auto traits . Trait objects implement the base trait, its auto traits, and any supertraits of the base trait. Trait objects are written as the optional keyword dyn followed by a set of trait bounds, but with the following restrictions on the trait bounds. All traits except the first trait must be auto traits, there may not be more than one lifetime, and opt-out bounds (e.g. ?sized ) are not allowed. Furthermore, paths to traits may be parenthesized. For example, given a trait Trait , the following are all trait objects: Trait dyn Trait dyn Trait + Send dyn Trait + Send + Sync dyn Trait + 'static dyn Trait + Send + 'static dyn Trait + dyn 'static + Trait . dyn (Trait) If the first bound of the trait object is a path that starts with :: , then the dyn will be treated as a part of the path. The first path can be put in parenthesis to get around this. As such, if you want a trait object with the trait ::your_module::Trait , you should write it as dyn (::your_module::Trait) . Note: For clarity, it is recommended to always use the dyn keyword on your trait objects unless your codebase supports compiling with Rust 1.26 or lower. Two trait object types alias each other if the base traits alias each other and if the sets of auto traits are the same and the lifetime bounds are the same. For example, dyn Trait + Send + UnwindSafe is the same as dyn Trait + Unwindsafe + Send . Warning: With two trait object types, even when the complete set of traits is the same, if the base traits differ, the type is different. For example, dyn Send + Sync is a different type from dyn Sync + Send . See issue 33140 . Due to the opaqueness of which concrete type the value is of, trait objects are dynamically sized types . Like all DSTs, trait objects are used behind some type of pointer; for example &dyn SomeTrait or Box<dyn SomeTrait> . Each instance of a pointer to a trait object includes: a pointer to an instance of a type T that implements SomeTrait a virtual method table , often just called a vtable , which contains, for each method of SomeTrait and its supertraits that T implements, a pointer to T 's implementation (i.e. a function pointer). The purpose of trait objects is to permit \"late binding\" of methods. Calling a method on a trait object results in virtual dispatch at runtime: that is, a function pointer is loaded from the trait object vtable and invoked indirectly. The actual implementation for each vtable entry can vary on an object-by-object basis. An example of a trait object: trait Printable { fn stringify(&self) -> String;\n} impl Printable for i32 { fn stringify(&self) -> String { self.to_string() }\n} fn print(a: Box<dyn Printable>) { println!(\"{}\", a.stringify());\n} fn main() { print(Box::new(10) as Box<dyn Printable>);\n} In this example, the trait Printable occurs as a trait object in both the type signature of print , and the cast expression in main .","id":"types.html#trait-objects","title":"Trait objects","breadcrumbs":"Type system » Trait objects"},"tokens.html#number-literals":{"title":"Number literals","body":"A number literal is either an integer literal or a floating-point literal .

If the program context under-constrains the type, it defaults to the signed 32-bit integer i32 . If the program context over-constrains the type, it is considered a static type error.

(DEC_DIGIT| _ )* DEC_DIGIT (DEC_DIGIT| _ )* FLOAT_SUFFIX : f32 | f64 A floating-point literal has one of two forms: A decimal literal followed by a period character U+002E ( . ). This is optionally followed by another decimal literal, with an optional exponent . A single decimal literal followed by an exponent . Like integer literals, a floating-point literal may be followed by a suffix, so long as the pre-suffix part does not end with U+002E ( . ). The suffix forcibly sets the type of the literal. There are two valid floating-point suffixes , f32 and f64 (the 32-bit and 64-bit floating point types), which explicitly determine the type of the literal. The type of an unsuffixed floating-point literal is determined by type inference: If a floating-point type can be uniquely determined from the surrounding program context, the unsuffixed floating-point literal has that type. If the program context under-constrains the type, it defaults to f64 . If the program context over-constrains the type, it is considered a static type error.

When a programmer has sufficient conviction that a sequence of potentially unsafe operations is actually safe, they can encapsulate that sequence (taken as a whole) within an unsafe block. The compiler will consider uses of such code safe, in the surrounding context. Unsafe blocks are used to wrap foreign libraries, make direct use of hardware or implement features not directly present in the language. For example, Rust provides the language features necessary to implement memory-safe concurrency in the language but the implementation of threads and message passing is in the standard library. Rust's type system is a conservative approximation of the dynamic safety requirements, so in some cases there is a performance cost to using safe code. For example, a doubly-linked list is not a tree structure and can only be represented with reference-counted pointers in safe code.

Promotion of a value expression to a 'static slot occurs when the expression could be written in a constant, borrowed, and dereferencing that borrow where the expression was the originally written, without changing the runtime behavior. That is, the promoted expression can be evaluated at compile-time and the resulting value does not contain interior mutability or destructors (these properties are determined based on the value where possible, e.g. &None always has the type &'static Option<_> , as it contains nothing disallowed). Otherwise, the lifetime of temporary values is typically the innermost enclosing statement; the tail expression of a block is considered part of the statement that encloses the block, or the condition expression or the loop conditional expression if the temporary is created in the condition expression of an if or in the loop conditional expression of a while expression. When a temporary value expression is being created that is assigned into a let declaration , however, the temporary is created with the lifetime of the enclosing block instead, as using the enclosing let declaration would be a guaranteed error (since a pointer to the temporary would be stored into a variable, but the temporary would be freed before the variable could be used). The compiler uses simple syntactic rules to decide which values are being assigned into a let binding, and therefore deserve a longer temporary lifetime. Here are some examples: let x = foo(&temp()) . The expression temp() is a value expression. As it is being borrowed, a temporary is created which will be freed after the innermost enclosing statement; in this case, the let declaration. let x = temp().foo() . This is the same as the previous example, except that the value of temp() is being borrowed via autoref on a method-call. Here we are assuming that foo() is an &self method defined in some trait, say Foo . In other words, the expression temp().foo() is equivalent to Foo::foo(&temp()) . let x = if foo(&temp()) {bar()} else {baz()}; . The expression temp() is a value expression. As the temporary is created in the condition expression of an if , it will be freed at the end of the condition expression; in this example before the call to bar or baz is made. let x = if temp().must_run_bar {bar()} else {baz()}; . Here we assume the type of temp() is a struct with a boolean field must_run_bar . As the previous example, the temporary corresponding to temp() will be freed at the end of the condition expression. while foo(&temp()) {bar();} . The temporary containing the return value from the call to temp() is created in the loop conditional expression. Hence it will be freed at the end of the loop conditional expression; in this example before the call to bar if the loop body is executed. let x = &temp() . Here, the same temporary is being assigned into x , rather than being passed as a parameter, and hence the temporary's lifetime is considered to be the enclosing block. let x = SomeStruct { foo: &temp() } . As in the previous case, the temporary is assigned into a struct which is then assigned into a binding, and hence it is given the lifetime of the enclosing block. let x = [ &temp() ] . As in the previous case, the temporary is assigned into an array which is then assigned into a binding, and hence it is given the lifetime of the enclosing block. let ref x = temp() .

The numbers must be written in decimal, containing no underscores and with no leading zeros or integer suffix.

Struct expressions can't be used directly in the head of a loop or an if , if let or match expression. But struct expressions can still be in used inside parentheses, for example. A tuple struct expression consists of the path of a struct item, followed by a parenthesized list of one or more comma-separated expressions (in other words, the path of a struct item followed by a tuple expression).

All targets in the compiler have a default mode of linking to the C runtime. Typically targets are linked dynamically by default, but there are exceptions which are static by default such as: arm-unknown-linux-musleabi arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf i686-unknown-linux-musl x86_64-unknown-linux-musl The linkage of the C runtime is configured to respect the crt-static target feature. These target features are typically configured from the command line via flags to the compiler itself. For example to enable a static runtime you would execute: rustc -C target-feature=+crt-static foo.rs whereas to link dynamically to the C runtime you would execute: rustc -C target-feature=-crt-static foo.rs Targets which do not support switching between linkage of the C runtime will ignore this flag. It's recommended to inspect the resulting binary to ensure that it's linked as you would expect after the compiler succeeds. Crates may also learn about how the C runtime is being linked. Code on MSVC, for example, needs to be compiled differently (e.g. with /MT or /MD ) depending on the runtime being linked. This is exported currently through the target_feature attribute (note this is a nightly feature): #[cfg(target_feature = \"crt-static\")]\nfn foo() { println!(\"the C runtime should be statically linked\");\n} #[cfg(not(target_feature = \"crt-static\"))]\nfn foo() { println!(\"the C runtime should be dynamically linked\");\n} Also note that Cargo build scripts can learn about this feature through environment variables . In a build script you can detect the linkage via: use std::env; fn main() { let linkage = env::var(\"CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE\").unwrap_or(String::new()); if linkage.contains(\"crt-static\") { println!(\"the C runtime will be statically linked\"); } else { println!(\"the C runtime will be dynamically linked\"); }\n} To use this feature locally, you typically will use the RUSTFLAGS environment variable to specify flags to the compiler through Cargo. For example to compile a statically linked binary on MSVC you would execute: RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+crt-static' cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc","title":"Static and dynamic C runtimes","breadcrumbs":"Static and dynamic C runtimes","id":"linkage.html#static-and-dynamic-c-runtimes"},"undocumented.html#as-yet-undocumented-features":{"title":"As-yet-undocumented Features","breadcrumbs":"As-yet-undocumented Features","body":"Several accepted, stabilized, and implemented RFCs lack documentation in this reference, The Book, Rust by Example , or some combination of those three.

MatchArm : OuterAttribute * MatchArmPatterns MatchArmGuard ? MatchArmPatterns : | ? Pattern ( | Pattern )* MatchArmGuard : if Expression A match expression branches on a pattern . The exact form of matching that occurs depends on the pattern. Patterns consist of some combination of literals, destructured arrays or enum constructors, structs and tuples, variable binding specifications, wildcards ( .. ), and placeholders ( _ ). A match expression has a head expression , which is the value to compare to the patterns. The type of the patterns must equal the type of the head expression. A match behaves differently depending on whether or not the head expression is a place expression or value expression . If the head expression is a value expression , it is first evaluated into a temporary location, and the resulting value is sequentially compared to the patterns in the arms until a match is found. The first arm with a matching pattern is chosen as the branch target of the match , any variables bound by the pattern are assigned to local variables in the arm's block, and control enters the block. When the head expression is a place expression , the match does not allocate a temporary location; however, a by-value binding may copy or move from the memory location. When possible, it is preferable to match on place expressions, as the lifetime of these matches inherits the lifetime of the place expression rather than being restricted to the inside of the match. An example of a match expression: let x = 1; match x { 1 => println!(\"one\"), 2 => println!(\"two\"), 3 => println!(\"three\"), 4 => println!(\"four\"), 5 => println!(\"five\"), _ => println!(\"something else\"),\n} Patterns that bind variables default to binding to a copy or move of the matched value (depending on the matched value's type). This can be changed to bind to a reference by using the ref keyword, or to a mutable reference using ref mut . Patterns can be used to destructure structs, enums, and tuples. Destructuring breaks a value up into its component pieces. The syntax used is the same as when creating such values. When destructing a data structure with named (but not numbered) fields, it is allowed to write fieldname as a shorthand for fieldname: fieldname . In a pattern whose head expression has a struct , enum or tupl type, a placeholder ( _ ) stands for a single data field, whereas a wildcard .. stands for all the fields of a particular variant. # enum Message {\n# Quit,\n# WriteString(String),\n# Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\n# ChangeColor(u8, u8, u8),\n# }\n# let message = Message::Quit;\nmatch message { Message::Quit => println!(\"Quit\"), Message::WriteString(write) => println!(\"{}\", &write), Message::Move{ x, y: 0 } => println!(\"move {} horizontally\", x), Message::Move{ .. } => println!(\"other move\"), Message::ChangeColor { 0: red, 1: green, 2: _ } => { println!(\"color change, red: {}, green: {}\", red, green); }\n}; Patterns can also dereference pointers by using the & , &mut and box symbols, as appropriate. For example, these two matches on x: &i32 are equivalent: # let x = &3;\nlet y = match *x { 0 => \"zero\", _ => \"some\" };\nlet z = match x { &0 => \"zero\", _ => \"some\" }; assert_eq!(y, z); Subpatterns can also be bound to variables by the use of the syntax variable @ subpattern . For example: let x = 1; match x { e @ 1 ... 5 => println!(\"got a range element {}\", e), _ => println!(\"anything\"),\n} Multiple match patterns may be joined with the | operator. An inclusive range of values may be specified with ..= . For example: # let x = 9;\nlet message = match x { 0 | 1 => \"not many\", 2 ..= 9 => \"a few\", _ => \"lots\"\n}; assert_eq!(message, \"a few\"); Other forms of [range] ( .. for an exclusive range, or any range with one or both endpoints left unspecified) are not supported in matches. The syntax ... is also accepted for inclusive ranges in patterns only, for backwards compatibility. Range patterns only work char and numeric types . A range pattern may not be a sub-range of another range pattern inside the same match . Slice patterns can match both arrays of fixed size and slices of dynamic size. // Fixed size\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3];\nmatch arr { [1, _, _] => \"starts with one\", [a, b, c] => \"starts with something else\",\n}; // Dynamic size\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3];\nmatch v[..] { [a, b] => { /* this arm will not apply because the length doesn't match */ } [a, b, c] => { /* this arm will apply */ } _ => { /* this wildcard is required, since we don't know length statically */ }\n} Finally, match patterns can accept pattern guards to further refine the criteria for matching a case. Pattern guards appear after the pattern and consist of a bool-typed expression following the if keyword. A pattern guard may refer to the variables bound within the pattern they follow. # let maybe_digit = Some(0);\n# fn process_digit(i: i32) { }\n# fn process_other(i: i32) { }\nlet message = match maybe_digit { Some(x) if x < 10 => process_digit(x), Some(x) => process_other(x), None => panic!(),\n};","title":"match expressions","id":"expressions/match-expr.html#match--expressions","breadcrumbs":"Statements and expressions » Expressions » match expressions"},"items/implementations.html#trait-implementations":{"id":"items/implementations.html#trait-implementations","breadcrumbs":"Items and attributes » Items » Trait Implementations","title":"Trait Implementations","body":"A trait implementation is defined like an inherent implementation except that the optional generic type declarations is followed by a trait followed by the keyword for .

We call such extensions \"macros by example\" or simply \"macros\". Currently, macros can expand to expressions, statements, items, or patterns. (A sep_token is any token other than * and + . A non_special_token is any token other than a delimiter or $ .) The macro expander looks up macro invocations by name, and tries each macro rule in turn. It transcribes the first successful match. Matching and transcription are closely related to each other, and we will describe them together. The macro expander matches and transcribes every token that does not begin with a $ literally, including delimiters. For parsing reasons, delimiters must be balanced, but they are otherwise not special. In the matcher, $ name : designator matches the nonterminal in the Rust syntax named by designator . Valid designators are: item : an item block : a block stmt : a statement pat : a pattern expr : an expression ty : a type ident : an identifier or keyword path : a path tt : a token tree (a single token by matching () , [] , or {} ) meta : the contents of an attribute lifetime : a lifetime. Examples: 'static , 'a . In the transcriber, the designator is already known, and so only the name of a matched nonterminal comes after the dollar sign. In both the matcher and transcriber, the Kleene star-like operator indicates repetition. The Kleene star operator consists of $ and parentheses, optionally followed by a separator token, followed by * or + . * means zero or more repetitions, + means at least one repetition. The parentheses are not matched or transcribed. On the matcher side, a name is bound to all of the names it matches, in a structure that mimics the structure of the repetition encountered on a successful match. The job of the transcriber is to sort that structure out. The rules for transcription of these repetitions are called \"Macro By Example\". Essentially, one \"layer\" of repetition is discharged at a time, and all of them must be discharged by the time a name is transcribed. Therefore, ( $( $i:ident ),* ) => ( $i ) is an invalid macro, but ( $( $i:ident ),* ) => ( $( $i:ident ),* ) is acceptable (if trivial). When Macro By Example encounters a repetition, it examines all of the $ name s that occur in its body. At the \"current layer\", they all must repeat the same number of times, so ( $( $i:ident ),* ; $( $j:ident ),* ) => ( $( ($i,$j) ),* ) is valid if given the argument (a,b,c ; d,e,f) , but not (a,b,c ; d,e) . The repetition walks through the choices at that layer in lockstep, so the former input transcribes to (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) .
