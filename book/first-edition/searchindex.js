We now have an extern crate adder at the top. This is because each test in the tests directory is an entirely separate crate, and so we need to import our library.

Even concurrent Rust programs must be memory safe, having no data races. Rust's type system is up to the task, and gives you powerful ways to reason about concurrent code at compile time. Before we talk about the concurrency features that come with Rust, it's important to understand something: Rust is low-level enough that the vast majority of this is provided by the standard library, not by the language.

We use them in variable bindings , match expressions , and other places, too. Let’s go on a whirlwind tour of all of the things patterns can do!

It's possible to create a binding for the value in the any case: let x = 1; match x { y => println!(\"x: {} y: {}\", x, y),\n} This prints: x: 1 y: 1 Note it is an error to have both a catch-all _ and a catch-all binding in the same match block: let x = 1; match x { y => println!(\"x: {} y: {}\", x, y), _ => println!(\"anything\"), // this causes an error as it is unreachable\n} There’s one pitfall with patterns: like anything that introduces a new binding, they introduce shadowing. For example: let x = 1;\nlet c = 'c'; match c { x => println!(\"x: {} c: {}\", x, c),\n} println!(\"x: {}\", x) This prints: x: c c: c\nx: 1 In other words, x => matches the pattern and introduces a new binding named x . This new binding is in scope for the match arm and takes on the value of c . Notice that the value of x outside the scope of the match has no bearing on the value of x within it.

Let's add the consumer: let nums = (1..100).collect::<Vec<i32>>(); Now, collect() will require that the range gives it some numbers, and so it will do the work of generating the sequence. Ranges are one of two basic iterators that you'll see. The other is iter() . iter() can turn a vector into a simple iterator that gives you each element in turn: let nums = vec![1, 2, 3]; for num in nums.iter() { println!(\"{}\", num);\n} These two basic iterators should serve you well.

However, there’s a trait that changes this behavior, and it’s called Copy .

For example: let v = 1; let v2 = v; println!(\"v is: {}\", v); In this case, v is an i32 , which implements the Copy trait. This means that, just like a move, when we assign v to v2 , a copy of the data is made. But, unlike a move, we can still use v afterward. This is because an i32 has no pointers to data somewhere else, copying it is a full copy. All primitive types implement the Copy trait and their ownership is therefore not moved like one would assume, following the ‘ownership rules’. To give an example, the two following snippets of code only compile because the i32 and bool types implement the Copy trait. fn main() { let a = 5; let _y = double(a); println!(\"{}\", a);\n} fn double(x: i32) -> i32 { x * 2\n} fn main() { let a = true; let _y = change_truth(a); println!(\"{}\", a);\n} fn change_truth(x: bool) -> bool { !x\n} If we had used types that do not implement the Copy trait, we would have gotten a compile error because we tried to use a moved value. error: use of moved value: `a`\nprintln!(\"{}\", a); ^ We will discuss how to make your own types Copy in the traits section.","id":"ownership.html#copy--types"},"bibliography.html#bibliography":{"breadcrumbs":"Bibliography","id":"bibliography.html#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","body":"This is a reading list of material relevant to Rust.

The comma is used to separate arguments we pass to functions and macros, if you’re passing more than one.

This includes references ( &T , &mut T ), boxes ( Box<T> ), and function pointers ( extern \"abi\" fn() ). When interfacing with C, pointers that might be null are often used, which would seem to require some messy transmute s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, the language provides a workaround. As a special case, an enum is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains exactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the non-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather, the empty variant is represented by putting a null value into the non-nullable field. This is called an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible types. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is Option<T> , where None corresponds to null . So Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int> is a correct way to represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type int (*)(int) ). Here is a contrived example. Let's say some C library has a facility for registering a callback, which gets called in certain situations. The callback is passed a function pointer and an integer and it is supposed to run the function with the integer as a parameter.

Generally speaking , this is good advice. However, unwrap can still be used judiciously. What exactly justifies use of unwrap is somewhat of a grey area and reasonable people can disagree. I'll summarize some of my opinions on the matter. In examples and quick 'n' dirty code. Sometimes you're writing examples or a quick program, and error handling simply isn't important. Beating the convenience of unwrap can be hard in such scenarios, so it is very appealing. When panicking indicates a bug in the program. When the invariants of your code should prevent a certain case from happening (like, say, popping from an empty stack), then panicking can be permissible. This is because it exposes a bug in your program. This can be explicit, like from an assert! failing, or it could be because your index into an array was out of bounds. This is probably not an exhaustive list. Moreover, when using an Option , it is often better to use its expect method. expect does exactly the same thing as unwrap , except it prints a message you give to expect . This makes the resulting panic a bit nicer to deal with, since it will show your message instead of “called unwrap on a None value.” My advice boils down to this: use good judgment. There's a reason why the words “never do X” or “Y is considered harmful” don't appear in my writing. There are trade-offs to all things, and it is up to you as the programmer to determine what is acceptable for your use cases. My goal is only to help you evaluate trade-offs as accurately as possible.

This can be sent freely between threads. C++'s shared_ptr is similar to Arc , however in the case of C++ the inner data is always mutable. For semantics similar to that from C++, we should use Arc<Mutex<T>> , Arc<RwLock<T>> , or Arc<UnsafeCell<T>> [1] ( UnsafeCell<T> is a cell type that can be used to hold any data and has no runtime cost, but accessing it requires unsafe blocks). The last one should only be used if we are certain that the usage won't cause any memory unsafety. Remember that writing to a struct is not an atomic operation, and many functions like vec.push() can reallocate internally and cause unsafe behavior, so even monotonicity may not be enough to justify UnsafeCell . Arc<UnsafeCell<T>> actually won't compile since UnsafeCell<T> isn't Send or Sync , but we can wrap it in a type and implement Send / Sync for it manually to get Arc<Wrapper<T>> where Wrapper is struct Wrapper<T>(UnsafeCell<T>) .

There are only two kinds of statements, and everything else is an expression. So what's the difference? Expressions return a value, and statements do not. That’s why we end up with ‘not all control paths return a value’ here: the statement x + 1; doesn’t return a value. There are two kinds of statements in Rust: ‘declaration statements’ and ‘expression statements’. Everything else is an expression. Let’s talk about declaration statements first. In some languages, variable bindings can be written as expressions, not statements. Like Ruby: x = y = 5 In Rust, however, using let to introduce a binding is not an expression. The following will produce a compile-time error: let x = (let y = 5); // Expected identifier, found keyword `let`. The compiler is telling us here that it was expecting to see the beginning of an expression, and a let can only begin a statement, not an expression. Note that assigning to an already-bound variable (e.g. y = 5 ) is still an expression, although its value is not particularly useful. Unlike other languages where an assignment evaluates to the assigned value (e.g. 5 in the previous example), in Rust the value of an assignment is an empty tuple () because the assigned value can have only one owner , and any other returned value would be too surprising: let mut y = 5; let x = (y = 6); // `x` has the value `()`, not `6`. The second kind of statement in Rust is the expression statement . Its purpose is to turn any expression into a statement. In practical terms, Rust's grammar expects statements to follow other statements. This means that you use semicolons to separate expressions from each other. This means that Rust looks a lot like most other languages that require you to use semicolons at the end of every line, and you will see semicolons at the end of almost every line of Rust code you see. What is this exception that makes us say \"almost\"? You saw it already, in this code: fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1\n} Our function claims to return an i32 , but with a semicolon, it would return () instead.

Sometimes, when writing certain kinds of libraries, you’ll need to get around Rust’s safety guarantees for some reason. In this case, you can use raw pointers to implement your library, while exposing a safe interface for your users. For example, * pointers are allowed to alias, allowing them to be used to write shared-ownership types, and even thread-safe shared memory types (the Rc<T> and Arc<T> types are both implemented entirely in Rust). Here are some things to remember about raw pointers that are different than other pointer types. They: are not guaranteed to point to valid memory and are not even guaranteed to be non-NULL (unlike both Box and & ); do not have any automatic clean-up, unlike Box , and so require manual resource management; are plain-old-data, that is, they don't move ownership, again unlike Box , hence the Rust compiler cannot protect against bugs like use-after-free; lack any form of lifetimes, unlike & , and so the compiler cannot reason about dangling pointers; and have no guarantees about aliasing or mutability other than mutation not being allowed directly through a *const T ."},"error-handling.html#composing--option--and--result":{"title":"Composing Option and Result","body":"So far, I've talked about combinators defined for Option and combinators defined for Result . We can use these combinators to compose results of different computations without doing explicit case analysis. Of course, in real code, things aren't always as clean. Sometimes you have a mix of Option and Result types. Must we resort to explicit case analysis, or can we continue using combinators? For now, let's revisit one of the first examples in this section: use std::env; fn main() { let mut argv = env::args(); let arg: String = argv.nth(1).unwrap(); // error 1 let n: i32 = arg.parse().unwrap(); // error 2 println!(\"{}\", 2 * n);\n} Given our new found knowledge of Option , Result and their various combinators, we should try to rewrite this so that errors are handled properly and the program doesn't panic if there's an error. The tricky aspect here is that argv.nth(1) produces an Option while arg.parse() produces a Result . These aren't directly composable. When faced with both an Option and a Result , the solution is usually to convert the Option to a Result . In our case, the absence of a command line parameter (from env::args() ) means the user didn't invoke the program correctly. We could use a String to describe the error. Let's try: use std::env; fn double_arg(mut argv: env::Args) -> Result<i32, String> { argv.nth(1) .ok_or(\"Please give at least one argument\".to_owned()) .and_then(|arg| arg.parse::<i32>().map_err(|err| err.to_string())) .map(|n| 2 * n)\n} fn main() { match double_arg(env::args()) { Ok(n) => println!(\"{}\", n), Err(err) => println!(\"Error: {}\", err), }\n} There are a couple new things in this example. The first is the use of the Option::ok_or combinator. This is one way to convert an Option into a Result . The conversion requires you to specify what error to use if Option is None . Like the other combinators we've seen, its definition is very simple: fn ok_or<T, E>(option: Option<T>, err: E) -> Result<T, E> { match option { Some(val) => Ok(val), None => Err(err), }\n} The other new combinator used here is Result::map_err . This is like Result::map , except it maps a function on to the error portion of a Result value. If the Result is an Ok(...) value, then it is returned unmodified. We use map_err here because it is necessary for the error types to remain the same (because of our use of and_then ). Since we chose to convert the Option<String> (from argv.nth(1) ) to a Result<String, String> , we must also convert the ParseIntError from arg.parse() to a String .","id":"error-handling.html#composing--option--and--result","breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » Composing Option and Result"},"documentation.html#security-note":{"body":"The Markdown in documentation comments is placed without processing into the final webpage.

This is significantly more likely to introduce a naming conflict. In our short program, it’s not a big deal, but as it grows, it becomes a problem. If we have conflicting names, Rust will give a compilation error. For example, if we made the japanese functions public, and tried to do this: extern crate phrases; use phrases::english::greetings::hello;\nuse phrases::japanese::greetings::hello; fn main() { println!(\"Hello in English: {}\", hello()); println!(\"Hello in Japanese: {}\", hello());\n} Rust will give us a compile-time error: Compiling phrases v0.0.1 (file:///home/you/projects/phrases)\nsrc/main.rs:4:5: 4:40 error: a value named `hello` has already been imported in this module [E0252]\nsrc/main.rs:4 use phrases::japanese::greetings::hello; ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nerror: aborting due to previous error\nCould not compile `phrases`. If we’re importing multiple names from the same module, we don’t have to type it out twice. Instead of this: use phrases::english::greetings;\nuse phrases::english::farewells; We can use this shortcut: use phrases::english::{greetings, farewells};","id":"crates-and-modules.html#importing-modules-with--use"},"primitive-types.html#fixed-size-types":{"title":"Fixed-size types","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Fixed-size types","body":"Fixed-size types have a specific number of bits in their representation.

This property can be very useful for editors and other tools that process code. It also has a few consequences for the design of Rust’s macro system. One consequence is that Rust must determine, when it parses a macro invocation, whether the macro stands in for zero or more items, zero or more methods, an expression, a statement, or a pattern. A macro invocation within a block could stand for some items, or for an expression / statement. Rust uses a simple rule to resolve this ambiguity. A macro invocation that stands for items must be either delimited by curly braces, e.g. foo! { ... } , or terminated by a semicolon, e.g. foo!(...); Another consequence of pre-expansion parsing is that the macro invocation must consist of valid Rust tokens. Furthermore, parentheses, brackets, and braces must be balanced within a macro invocation. For example, foo!([) is forbidden. This allows Rust to know where the macro invocation ends. More formally, the macro invocation body must be a sequence of ‘token trees’. A token tree is defined recursively as either a sequence of token trees surrounded by matching () , [] , or {} , or any other single token. Within a matcher, each metavariable has a ‘fragment specifier’, identifying which syntactic form it matches. ident : an identifier. Examples: x ; foo . path : a qualified name. Example: T::SpecialA . expr : an expression. Examples: 2 + 2 ; if true { 1 } else { 2 } ; f(42) . ty : a type. Examples: i32 ; Vec<(char, String)> ; &T . pat : a pattern. Examples: Some(t) ; (17, 'a') ; _ . stmt : a single statement. Example: let x = 3 . block : a brace-delimited sequence of statements and optionally an expression. Example: { log(error, \"hi\"); return 12; } . item : an item . Examples: fn foo() { } ; struct Bar; . meta : a \"meta item\", as found in attributes. Example: cfg(target_os = \"windows\") . tt : a single token tree. There are additional rules regarding the next token after a metavariable: expr and stmt variables may only be followed by one of: => , ; ty and path variables may only be followed by one of: => , = | ; : > [ { as where pat variables may only be followed by one of: => , = | if in Other variables may be followed by any token. These rules provide some flexibility for Rust’s syntax to evolve without breaking existing macros. The macro system does not deal with parse ambiguity at all. For example, the grammar $($i:ident)* $e:expr will always fail to parse, because the parser would be forced to choose between parsing $i and parsing $e . Changing the invocation syntax to put a distinctive token in front can solve the problem. In this case, you can write $(I $i:ident)* E $e:expr .","id":"macros.html#syntactic-requirements","title":"Syntactic requirements"},"casting-between-types.html#explicit-coercions":{"id":"casting-between-types.html#explicit-coercions","body":"A cast e as U is valid if e has type T and T coerces to U .","title":"Explicit coercions","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Explicit coercions"},"raw-pointers.html#basics":{"body":"Creating a raw pointer is perfectly safe: let x = 5;\nlet raw = &x as *const i32; let mut y = 10;\nlet raw_mut = &mut y as *mut i32; However, dereferencing one is not.

It is still possible to violate your own invariants using this wrapper, so be careful when using it. If a field is wrapped in Cell , it's a nice indicator that the chunk of data is mutable and may not stay the same between the time you first read it and when you intend to use it. use std::cell::Cell; let x = Cell::new(1);\nlet y = &x;\nlet z = &x;\nx.set(2);\ny.set(3);\nz.set(4);\nprintln!(\"{}\", x.get()); Note that here we were able to mutate the same value from various immutable references.

Guarantees This relaxes the “no aliasing with mutability” restriction in places where it's unnecessary.

This is useful for mutating primitives and other types when there is no easy way of doing it in line with the static rules of & and &mut . Cell does not let you obtain interior references to the data, which makes it safe to freely mutate.

The AsRef<Path> is used because those are the same bounds used on std::fs::File::open . This makes it ergonomic to use any kind of string as a file path.) There are three different errors that can occur here: A problem opening the file. A problem reading data from the file. A problem parsing the data as a number. The first two problems are described via the std::io::Error type. We know this because of the return types of std::fs::File::open and std::io::Read::read_to_string . (Note that they both use the Result type alias idiom described previously. If you click on the Result type, you'll see the type alias , and consequently, the underlying io::Error type.) The third problem is described by the std::num::ParseIntError type. The io::Error type in particular is pervasive throughout the standard library. You will see it again and again. Let's start the process of refactoring the file_double function. To make this function composable with other components of the program, it should not panic if any of the above error conditions are met. Effectively, this means that the function should return an error if any of its operations fail. Our problem is that the return type of file_double is i32 , which does not give us any useful way of reporting an error. Thus, we must start by changing the return type from i32 to something else. The first thing we need to decide: should we use Option or Result ? We certainly could use Option very easily. If any of the three errors occur, we could simply return None . This will work and it is better than panicking , but we can do much better. Instead, we should pass some detail about the error that occurred. Since we want to express the possibility of error , we should use Result<i32, E> . But what should E be? Since two different types of errors can occur, we need to convert them to a common type. One such type is String . Let's see how that impacts our code: use std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::Read;\nuse std::path::Path; fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, String> { File::open(file_path) .map_err(|err| err.to_string()) .and_then(|mut file| { let mut contents = String::new(); file.read_to_string(&mut contents) .map_err(|err| err.to_string()) .map(|_| contents) }) .and_then(|contents| { contents.trim().parse::<i32>() .map_err(|err| err.to_string()) }) .map(|n| 2 * n)\n} fn main() { match file_double(\"foobar\") { Ok(n) => println!(\"{}\", n), Err(err) => println!(\"Error: {}\", err), }\n} This code looks a bit hairy. It can take quite a bit of practice before code like this becomes easy to write. The way we write it is by following the types . As soon as we changed the return type of file_double to Result<i32, String> , we had to start looking for the right combinators. In this case, we only used three different combinators: and_then , map and map_err . and_then is used to chain multiple computations where each computation could return an error. After opening the file, there are two more computations that could fail: reading from the file and parsing the contents as a number. Correspondingly, there are two calls to and_then . map is used to apply a function to the Ok(...) value of a Result . For example, the very last call to map multiplies the Ok(...) value (which is an i32 ) by 2 . If an error had occurred before that point, this operation would have been skipped because of how map is defined. map_err is the trick that makes all of this work. map_err is like map , except it applies a function to the Err(...) value of a Result . In this case, we want to convert all of our errors to one type: String . Since both io::Error and num::ParseIntError implement ToString , we can call the to_string() method to convert them. With all of that said, the code is still hairy. Mastering use of combinators is important, but they have their limits. Let's try a different approach: early returns.","title":"The limits of combinators"},"method-syntax.html#associated-functions":{"body":"You can also define associated functions that do not take a self parameter.

A library can choose to expose only the safe, high-level interface and hide the unsafe internal details. Wrapping the functions which expect buffers involves using the slice::raw module to manipulate Rust vectors as pointers to memory. Rust's vectors are guaranteed to be a contiguous block of memory. The length is the number of elements currently contained, and the capacity is the total size in elements of the allocated memory. The length is less than or equal to the capacity. # extern crate libc;\n# use libc::{c_int, size_t};\n# unsafe fn snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(_: *const u8, _: size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# fn main() {}\npub fn validate_compressed_buffer(src: &[u8]) -> bool { unsafe { snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(src.as_ptr(), src.len() as size_t) == 0 }\n} The validate_compressed_buffer wrapper above makes use of an unsafe block, but it makes the guarantee that calling it is safe for all inputs by leaving off unsafe from the function signature. The snappy_compress and snappy_uncompress functions are more complex, since a buffer has to be allocated to hold the output too. The snappy_max_compressed_length function can be used to allocate a vector with the maximum required capacity to hold the compressed output. The vector can then be passed to the snappy_compress function as an output parameter. An output parameter is also passed to retrieve the true length after compression for setting the length. # extern crate libc;\n# use libc::{size_t, c_int};\n# unsafe fn snappy_compress(a: *const u8, b: size_t, c: *mut u8,\n# d: *mut size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_max_compressed_length(a: size_t) -> size_t { a }\n# fn main() {}\npub fn compress(src: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> { unsafe { let srclen = src.len() as size_t; let psrc = src.as_ptr(); let mut dstlen = snappy_max_compressed_length(srclen); let mut dst = Vec::with_capacity(dstlen as usize); let pdst = dst.as_mut_ptr(); snappy_compress(psrc, srclen, pdst, &mut dstlen); dst.set_len(dstlen as usize); dst }\n} Decompression is similar, because snappy stores the uncompressed size as part of the compression format and snappy_uncompressed_length will retrieve the exact buffer size required. # extern crate libc;\n# use libc::{size_t, c_int};\n# unsafe fn snappy_uncompress(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t,\n# uncompressed: *mut u8,\n# uncompressed_length: *mut size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_uncompressed_length(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t,\n# result: *mut size_t) -> c_int { 0 }\n# fn main() {}\npub fn uncompress(src: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>> { unsafe { let srclen = src.len() as size_t; let psrc = src.as_ptr(); let mut dstlen: size_t = 0; snappy_uncompressed_length(psrc, srclen, &mut dstlen); let mut dst = Vec::with_capacity(dstlen as usize); let pdst = dst.as_mut_ptr(); if snappy_uncompress(psrc, srclen, pdst, &mut dstlen) == 0 { dst.set_len(dstlen as usize); Some(dst) } else { None // SNAPPY_INVALID_INPUT } }\n} Then, we can add some tests to show how to use them. # extern crate libc;\n# use libc::{c_int, size_t};\n# unsafe fn snappy_compress(input: *const u8,\n# input_length: size_t,\n# compressed: *mut u8,\n# compressed_length: *mut size_t)\n# -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_uncompress(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t,\n# uncompressed: *mut u8,\n# uncompressed_length: *mut size_t)\n# -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_max_compressed_length(source_length: size_t) -> size_t { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_uncompressed_length(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t,\n# result: *mut size_t)\n# -> c_int { 0 }\n# unsafe fn snappy_validate_compressed_buffer(compressed: *const u8,\n# compressed_length: size_t)\n# -> c_int { 0 }\n# fn main() { } #[cfg(test)]\nmod tests { use super::*; #[test] fn valid() { let d = vec![0xde, 0xad, 0xd0, 0x0d]; let c: &[u8] = &compress(&d); assert!(validate_compressed_buffer(c)); assert!(uncompress(c) == Some(d)); } #[test] fn invalid() { let d = vec![0, 0, 0, 0]; assert!(!validate_compressed_buffer(&d)); assert!(uncompress(&d).is_none()); } #[test] fn empty() { let d = vec![]; assert!(!validate_compressed_buffer(&d)); assert!(uncompress(&d).is_none()); let c = compress(&d); assert!(validate_compressed_buffer(&c)); assert!(uncompress(&c) == Some(d)); }\n}","id":"ffi.html#creating-a-safe-interface","breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » Creating a safe interface"},"getting-started.html#getting-started":{"body":"This first chapter of the book will get us going with Rust and its tooling.

Variable bindings have a scope - they are constrained to live in the block they were defined in. A block is a collection of statements enclosed by { and } . Function definitions are also blocks! In the following example we define two variable bindings, x and y , which live in different blocks. x can be accessed from inside the fn main() {} block, while y can be accessed only from inside the inner block: fn main() { let x: i32 = 17; { let y: i32 = 3; println!(\"The value of x is {} and value of y is {}\", x, y); } println!(\"The value of x is {} and value of y is {}\", x, y); // This won't work.\n} The first println! would print \"The value of x is 17 and the value of y is 3\", but this example cannot be compiled successfully, because the second println! cannot access the value of y , since it is not in scope anymore.

Shadowing and mutable bindings may appear as two sides of the same coin, but they are two distinct concepts that can't always be used interchangeably. For one, shadowing enables us to rebind a name to a value of a different type. It is also possible to change the mutability of a binding. Note that shadowing a name does not alter or destroy the value it was bound to, and the value will continue to exist until it goes out of scope, even if it is no longer accessible by any means. let mut x: i32 = 1;\nx = 7;\nlet x = x; // `x` is now immutable and is bound to `7`. let y = 4;\nlet y = \"I can also be bound to text!\"; // `y` is now of a different type.","id":"variable-bindings.html#scope-and-shadowing","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Scope and shadowing"},"ffi.html#accessing-foreign-globals":{"body":"Foreign APIs often export a global variable which could do something like track global state.

However, there’s a language feature related to Deref : ‘deref coercions’. Here’s the rule: If you have a type U , and it implements Deref<Target=T> , values of &U will automatically coerce to a &T . Here’s an example: fn foo(s: &str) { // Borrow a string for a second.\n} // String implements Deref<Target=str>.\nlet owned = \"Hello\".to_string(); // Therefore, this works:\nfoo(&owned); Using an ampersand in front of a value takes a reference to it. So owned is a String , &owned is an &String , and since impl Deref<Target=str> for String , &String will deref to &str , which foo() takes. That’s it. This rule is one of the only places in which Rust does an automatic conversion for you, but it adds a lot of flexibility. For example, the Rc<T> type implements Deref<Target=T> , so this works: use std::rc::Rc; fn foo(s: &str) { // Borrow a string for a second.\n} // String implements Deref<Target=str>.\nlet owned = \"Hello\".to_string();\nlet counted = Rc::new(owned); // Therefore, this works:\nfoo(&counted); All we’ve done is wrap our String in an Rc<T> . But we can now pass the Rc<String> around anywhere we’d have a String . The signature of foo didn’t change, but works just as well with either type. This example has two conversions: &Rc<String> to &String and then &String to &str . Rust will do this as many times as possible until the types match. Another very common implementation provided by the standard library is: fn foo(s: &[i32]) { // Borrow a slice for a second.\n} // Vec<T> implements Deref<Target=[T]>.\nlet owned = vec![1, 2, 3]; foo(&owned); Vectors can Deref to a slice.","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Deref coercions","title":"Deref coercions"},"loops.html#loop":{"body":"The infinite loop is the simplest form of loop available in Rust.

This memory needs to be allocated from somewhere. Rust ‘stack allocates’ by default, which means that basic values ‘go on the stack’. What does that mean? Well, when a function gets called, some memory gets allocated for all of its local variables and some other information. This is called a ‘stack frame’, and for the purpose of this tutorial, we’re going to ignore the extra information and only consider the local variables we’re allocating. So in this case, when main() is run, we’ll allocate a single 32-bit integer for our stack frame. This is automatically handled for you, as you can see; we didn’t have to write any special Rust code or anything. When the function exits, its stack frame gets deallocated. This happens automatically as well. That’s all there is for this simple program. The key thing to understand here is that stack allocation is very, very fast. Since we know all the local variables we have ahead of time, we can grab the memory all at once. And since we’ll throw them all away at the same time as well, we can get rid of it very fast too. The downside is that we can’t keep values around if we need them for longer than a single function. We also haven’t talked about what the word, ‘stack’, means. To do that, we need a slightly more complicated example: fn foo() { let y = 5; let z = 100;\n} fn main() { let x = 42; foo();\n} This program has three variables total: two in foo() , one in main() . Just as before, when main() is called, a single integer is allocated for its stack frame. But before we can show what happens when foo() is called, we need to visualize what’s going on with memory. Your operating system presents a view of memory to your program that’s pretty simple: a huge list of addresses, from 0 to a large number, representing how much RAM your computer has. For example, if you have a gigabyte of RAM, your addresses go from 0 to 1,073,741,823 . That number comes from 230, the number of bytes in a gigabyte. [1] ‘Gigabyte’ can mean two things: 109, or 230. The IEC standard resolved this by stating that ‘gigabyte’ is 109, and ‘gibibyte’ is 230. However, very few people use this terminology, and rely on context to differentiate. We follow in that tradition here. This memory is kind of like a giant array: addresses start at zero and go up to the final number. So here’s a diagram of our first stack frame: Address Name Value 0 x 42 We’ve got x located at address 0 , with the value 42 . When foo() is called, a new stack frame is allocated: Address Name Value 2 z 100 1 y 5 0 x 42 Because 0 was taken by the first frame, 1 and 2 are used for foo() ’s stack frame. It grows upward, the more functions we call. Notice that we are not taking into account the size of each variable (for example, a 32 bit variable would use the memory addresses from 0 to 3, or 4 bytes). There are some important things we have to take note of here. The numbers 0, 1, and 2 are all solely for illustrative purposes, and bear no relationship to the address values the computer will use in reality. In particular, the series of addresses are in reality going to be separated by some number of bytes that separate each address, and that separation may even exceed the size of the value being stored. After foo() is over, its frame is deallocated: Address Name Value 0 x 42 And then, after main() , even this last value goes away. Easy! It’s called a ‘stack’ because it works like a stack of dinner plates: the first plate you put down is the last plate to pick back up. Stacks are sometimes called ‘last in, first out queues’ for this reason, as the last value you put on the stack is the first one you retrieve from it. Let’s try a three-deep example: fn italic() { let i = 6;\n} fn bold() { let a = 5; let b = 100; let c = 1; italic();\n} fn main() { let x = 42; bold();\n} We have some kooky function names to make the diagrams clearer. Okay, first, we call main() : Address Name Value 0 x 42 Next up, main() calls bold() : Address Name Value 3 c 1 2 b 100 1 a 5 0 x 42 And then bold() calls italic() : Address Name Value 4 i 6 3 c 1 2 b 100 1 a 5 0 x 42 Whew! Our stack is growing tall. After italic() is over, its frame is deallocated, leaving only bold() and main() : Address Name Value 3 c 1 2 b 100 1 a 5 0 x 42 And then bold() ends, leaving only main() : Address Name Value 0 x 42 And then we’re done.

Careful readers will also note that tuples are heterogeneous: we have an i32 and a &str in this tuple. In systems programming languages, strings are a bit more complex than in other languages. For now, read &str as a string slice , and we’ll learn more soon. You can assign one tuple into another, if they have the same contained types and arity .

This will prove useful for writing composable code as we'll see later. Otherwise, the trait allows you to do at least the following things: Obtain a Debug representation of the error. Obtain a user-facing Display representation of the error. Inspect the causal chain of an error, if one exists (via the cause method). The first two are a result of Error requiring impls for both Debug and Display . The latter two are from the two methods defined on Error . The power of Error comes from the fact that all error types impl Error , which means errors can be existentially quantified as a trait object . This manifests as either Box<Error> or &Error . Indeed, the cause method returns an &Error , which is itself a trait object. We'll revisit the Error trait's utility as a trait object later. For now, it suffices to show an example implementing the Error trait. Let's use the error type we defined in the previous section : use std::io;\nuse std::num; // We derive `Debug` because all types should probably derive `Debug`.\n// This gives us a reasonable human-readable description of `CliError` values.\n#[derive(Debug)]\nenum CliError { Io(io::Error), Parse(num::ParseIntError),\n} This particular error type represents the possibility of two types of errors occurring: an error dealing with I/O or an error converting a string to a number. The error could represent as many error types as you want by adding new variants to the enum definition. Implementing Error is pretty straight-forward. It's mostly going to be a lot explicit case analysis. use std::error;\nuse std::fmt; impl fmt::Display for CliError { fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result { match *self { // Both underlying errors already impl `Display`, so we defer to // their implementations.

Both of these implicitly cast `err` from their concrete // types (either `&io::Error` or `&num::ParseIntError`) // to a trait object `&Error`. This works because both error types // implement `Error`. CliError::Io(ref err) => Some(err), CliError::Parse(ref err) => Some(err), } }\n} We note that this is a very typical implementation of Error : match on your different error types and satisfy the contracts defined for cause .","title":"The Error trait","breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » The Error trait"},"getting-started.html#uninstalling":{"title":"Uninstalling","body":"Uninstalling Rust is as easy as installing it: $ rustup self uninstall","id":"getting-started.html#uninstalling","breadcrumbs":"Uninstalling"},"choosing-your-guarantees.html#mutext--and--rwlockt":{"body":"Mutex<T> and RwLock<T> provide mutual-exclusion via RAII guards (guards are objects which maintain some state, like a lock, until their destructor is called).

This guard can be used to access the inner data (mutably), and the lock will be released when the guard goes out of scope. { let guard = mutex.lock(); // `guard` dereferences mutably to the inner type. *guard += 1;\n} // Lock is released when destructor runs. RwLock has the added benefit of being efficient for multiple reads. It is always safe to have multiple readers to shared data as long as there are no writers; and RwLock lets readers acquire a \"read lock\". Such locks can be acquired concurrently and are kept track of via a reference count. Writers must obtain a \"write lock\" which can only be obtained when all readers have gone out of scope. Guarantees Both of these provide safe shared mutability across threads, however they are prone to deadlocks. Some level of additional protocol safety can be obtained via the type system.

If the parent also has macro_use then the macros will be visible in the grandparent after the parent’s mod item, and so forth. The macro_use attribute can also appear on extern crate .

Consider, for example, Arc<T> : use std::sync::Arc; let x = Arc::new(5);\nlet y = x.clone(); When we call clone() , the Arc<T> needs to update the reference count. Yet we’ve not used any mut s here, x is an immutable binding, and we didn’t take &mut 5 or anything. So what gives? To understand this, we have to go back to the core of Rust’s guiding philosophy, memory safety, and the mechanism by which Rust guarantees it, the ownership system, and more specifically, borrowing : You may have one or the other of these two kinds of borrows, but not both at the same time: one or more references ( &T ) to a resource, exactly one mutable reference ( &mut T ). So, that’s the real definition of ‘immutability’: is this safe to have two pointers to? In Arc<T> ’s case, yes: the mutation is entirely contained inside the structure itself. It’s not user facing. For this reason, it hands out &T with clone() . If it handed out &mut T s, though, that would be a problem. Other types, like the ones in the std::cell module, have the opposite: interior mutability. For example: use std::cell::RefCell; let x = RefCell::new(42); let y = x.borrow_mut(); RefCell hands out &mut references to what’s inside of it with the borrow_mut() method. Isn’t that dangerous? What if we do: use std::cell::RefCell; let x = RefCell::new(42); let y = x.borrow_mut();\nlet z = x.borrow_mut();\n# (y, z); This will in fact panic, at runtime. This is what RefCell does: it enforces Rust’s borrowing rules at runtime, and panic! s if they’re violated. This allows us to get around another aspect of Rust’s mutability rules. Let’s talk about it first."},"functions.html#functions":{"body":"Every Rust program has at least one function, the main function: fn main() {\n} This is the simplest possible function declaration. As we mentioned before, fn says ‘this is a function’, followed by the name, some parentheses because this function takes no arguments, and then some curly braces to indicate the body. Here’s a function named foo : fn foo() {\n} So, what about taking arguments? Here’s a function that prints a number: fn print_number(x: i32) { println!(\"x is: {}\", x);\n} Here’s a complete program that uses print_number : fn main() { print_number(5);\n} fn print_number(x: i32) { println!(\"x is: {}\", x);\n} As you can see, function arguments work very similar to let declarations: you add a type to the argument name, after a colon. Here’s a complete program that adds two numbers together and prints them: fn main() { print_sum(5, 6);\n} fn print_sum(x: i32, y: i32) { println!(\"sum is: {}\", x + y);\n} You separate arguments with a comma, both when you call the function, as well as when you declare it. Unlike let , you must declare the types of function arguments. This does not work: fn print_sum(x, y) { println!(\"sum is: {}\", x + y);\n} You get this error: expected one of `!`, `:`, or `@`, found `)`\nfn print_sum(x, y) { This is a deliberate design decision. While full-program inference is possible, languages which have it, like Haskell, often suggest that documenting your types explicitly is a best-practice. We agree that forcing functions to declare types while allowing for inference inside of function bodies is a wonderful sweet spot between full inference and no inference. What about returning a value? Here’s a function that adds one to an integer: fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1\n} Rust functions return exactly one value, and you declare the type after an ‘arrow’, which is a dash ( - ) followed by a greater-than sign ( > ). The last line of a function determines what it returns. You’ll note the lack of a semicolon here. If we added it in: fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1;\n} We would get an error: error: not all control paths return a value\nfn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1;\n} help: consider removing this semicolon: x + 1; ^ This reveals two interesting things about Rust: it is an expression-based language, and semicolons are different from semicolons in other ‘curly brace and semicolon’-based languages.

It returns a handle to the thread, that can be used to wait for the child thread to finish and extract its result: use std::thread; fn main() { let handle = thread::spawn(|| { \"Hello from a thread!\" }); println!(\"{}\", handle.join().unwrap());\n} As closures can capture variables from their environment, we can also try to bring some data into the other thread: use std::thread; fn main() { let x = 1; thread::spawn(|| { println!(\"x is {}\", x); });\n} However, this gives us an error: 5:19: 7:6 error: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `x`, which is owned by the current function\n...\n5:19: 7:6 help: to force the closure to take ownership of `x` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword, as shown: thread::spawn(move || { println!(\"x is {}\", x); }); This is because by default closures capture variables by reference, and thus the closure only captures a reference to x . This is a problem, because the thread may outlive the scope of x , leading to a dangling pointer. To fix this, we use a move closure as mentioned in the error message. move closures are explained in depth here ; basically they move variables from their environment into themselves. use std::thread; fn main() { let x = 1; thread::spawn(move || { println!(\"x is {}\", x); });\n} Many languages have the ability to execute threads, but it's wildly unsafe.

We'll break that process down and examine each step now. Before running a Rust program, you have to compile it. You can use the Rust compiler by entering the rustc command and passing it the name of your source file, like this: $ rustc main.rs If you come from a C or C++ background, you'll notice that this is similar to gcc or clang . After compiling successfully, Rust should output a binary executable, which you can see on Linux or macOS by entering the ls command in your shell as follows: $ ls\nmain main.rs On Windows, you'd enter: $ dir\nmain.exe\nmain.rs This shows we have two files: the source code, with an .rs extension, and the executable ( main.exe on Windows, main everywhere else). All that's left to do from here is run the main or main.exe file, like this: $ ./main # or .\\main.exe on Windows If main.rs were your \"Hello, world!\" program, this would print Hello, world! to your terminal. If you come from a dynamic language like Ruby, Python, or JavaScript, you may not be used to compiling and running a program being separate steps. Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, which means that you can compile a program, give it to someone else, and they can run it even without Rust installed. If you give someone a .rb or .py or .js file, on the other hand, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation installed (respectively), but you only need one command to both compile and run your program. Everything is a tradeoff in language design. Just compiling with rustc is fine for simple programs, but as your project grows, you'll want to be able to manage all of the options your project has, and make it easy to share your code with other people and projects.

Since we have three distinct errors (IO, CSV parsing and not found), let's define an enum with three variants: #[derive(Debug)]\nenum CliError { Io(io::Error), Csv(csv::Error), NotFound,\n} And now for impls on Display and Error : use std::fmt; impl fmt::Display for CliError { fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result { match *self { CliError::Io(ref err) => err.fmt(f), CliError::Csv(ref err) => err.fmt(f), CliError::NotFound => write!(f, \"No matching cities with a \\ population were found.\"), } }\n} impl Error for CliError { fn cause(&self) -> Option<&Error> { match *self { CliError::Io(ref err) => Some(err), CliError::Csv(ref err) => Some(err), // Our custom error doesn't have an underlying cause, // but we could modify it so that it does.

Well, we'll need to convert from both io::Error and csv::Error to CliError . Those are the only external errors, so we'll only need two From impls for now: impl From<io::Error> for CliError { fn from(err: io::Error) -> CliError { CliError::Io(err) }\n} impl From<csv::Error> for CliError { fn from(err: csv::Error) -> CliError { CliError::Csv(err) }\n} The From impls are important because of how try! is defined . In particular, if an error occurs, From::from is called on the error, which in this case, will convert it to our own error type CliError .

The first is that we did not need to annotate the types of arguments the closure takes or the values it returns. We can: let plus_one = |x: i32| -> i32 { x + 1 }; assert_eq!(2, plus_one(1)); But we don’t have to. Why is this? Basically, it was chosen for ergonomic reasons. While specifying the full type for named functions is helpful with things like documentation and type inference, the full type signatures of closures are rarely documented since they’re anonymous, and they don’t cause the kinds of error-at-a-distance problems that inferring named function types can. The second is that the syntax is similar, but a bit different.

Ha! quit actually quits. As does any other non-number input. Well, this is suboptimal to say the least. First, let’s actually quit when you win the game: extern crate rand; use std::io;\nuse std::cmp::Ordering;\nuse rand::Rng; fn main() { println!(\"Guess the number!\"); let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); println!(\"The secret number is: {}\", secret_number); loop { println!(\"Please input your guess.\"); let mut guess = String::new(); io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess) .expect(\"Failed to read line\"); let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse() .expect(\"Please type a number!\"); println!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess); match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { Ordering::Less => println!(\"Too small!\"), Ordering::Greater => println!(\"Too big!\"), Ordering::Equal => { println!(\"You win!\"); break; } } }\n} By adding the break line after the You win! , we’ll exit the loop when we win. Exiting the loop also means exiting the program, since it’s the last thing in main() . We have only one more tweak to make: when someone inputs a non-number, we don’t want to quit, we want to ignore it. We can do that like this: extern crate rand; use std::io;\nuse std::cmp::Ordering;\nuse rand::Rng; fn main() { println!(\"Guess the number!\"); let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); println!(\"The secret number is: {}\", secret_number); loop { println!(\"Please input your guess.\"); let mut guess = String::new(); io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess) .expect(\"Failed to read line\"); let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() { Ok(num) => num, Err(_) => continue, }; println!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess); match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { Ordering::Less => println!(\"Too small!\"), Ordering::Greater => println!(\"Too big!\"), Ordering::Equal => { println!(\"You win!\"); break; } } }\n} These are the lines that changed: let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() { Ok(num) => num, Err(_) => continue,\n}; This is how you generally move from ‘crash on error’ to ‘actually handle the error’, by switching from expect() to a match statement. A Result is returned by parse() , this is an enum like Ordering , but in this case, each variant has some data associated with it: Ok is a success, and Err is a failure. Each contains more information: the successfully parsed integer, or an error type. In this case, we match on Ok(num) , which sets the name num to the unwrapped Ok value (the integer), and then we return it on the right-hand side. In the Err case, we don’t care what kind of error it is, so we just use the catch all _ instead of a name. This catches everything that isn't Ok , and continue lets us move to the next iteration of the loop; in effect, this enables us to ignore all errors and continue with our program. Now we should be good!

Its real definition is in the standard library : macro_rules! try { ($e:expr) => (match $e { Ok(val) => val, Err(err) => return Err(::std::convert::From::from(err)), });\n} There's one tiny but powerful change: the error value is passed through From::from . This makes the try! macro much more powerful because it gives you automatic type conversion for free. Armed with our more powerful try! macro, let's take a look at code we wrote previously to read a file and convert its contents to an integer: use std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::Read;\nuse std::path::Path; fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, String> { let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path).map_err(|e| e.to_string())); let mut contents = String::new(); try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents).map_err(|e| e.to_string())); let n = try!(contents.trim().parse::<i32>().map_err(|e| e.to_string())); Ok(2 * n)\n} Earlier, we promised that we could get rid of the map_err calls. Indeed, all we have to do is pick a type that From works with. As we saw in the previous section, From has an impl that lets it convert any error type into a Box<Error> : use std::error::Error;\nuse std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::Read;\nuse std::path::Path; fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, Box<Error>> { let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path)); let mut contents = String::new(); try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents)); let n = try!(contents.trim().parse::<i32>()); Ok(2 * n)\n} We are getting very close to ideal error handling. Our code has very little overhead as a result from error handling because the try! macro encapsulates three things simultaneously: Case analysis. Control flow. Error type conversion. When all three things are combined, we get code that is unencumbered by combinators, calls to unwrap or case analysis. There's one little nit left: the Box<Error> type is opaque . If we return a Box<Error> to the caller, the caller can't (easily) inspect underlying error type. The situation is certainly better than String because the caller can call methods like cause , but the limitation remains: Box<Error> is opaque. (N.B. This isn't entirely true because Rust does have runtime reflection, which is useful in some scenarios that are beyond the scope of this section .)

Here's the first piece of the puzzle: fn main() { } These lines define a function in Rust. The main function is special: it's the beginning of every Rust program. The first line says, “I’m declaring a function named main that takes no arguments and returns nothing.” If there were arguments, they would go inside the parentheses ( ( and ) ), and because we aren’t returning anything from this function, we can omit the return type entirely. Also note that the function body is wrapped in curly braces ( { and } ). Rust requires these around all function bodies. It's considered good style to put the opening curly brace on the same line as the function declaration, with one space in between. Inside the main() function: println!(\"Hello, world!\"); This line does all of the work in this little program: it prints text to the screen. There are a number of details that are important here. The first is that it’s indented with four spaces, not tabs. The second important part is the println!() line. This is calling a Rust macro , which is how metaprogramming is done in Rust. If it were calling a function instead, it would look like this: println() (without the !). We'll discuss Rust macros in more detail later, but for now you only need to know that when you see a ! that means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function. Next is \"Hello, world!\" which is a string . Strings are a surprisingly complicated topic in a systems programming language, and this is a statically allocated string. We pass this string as an argument to println! , which prints the string to the screen. Easy enough! The line ends with a semicolon ( ; ). Rust is an expression-oriented language , which means that most things are expressions, rather than statements. The ; indicates that this expression is over, and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a ; .","title":"Anatomy of a Rust Program"},"traits.html#trait-bounds-on-generic-functions":{"title":"Trait bounds on generic functions","body":"Traits are useful because they allow a type to make certain promises about its behavior.

But we can add a trait bound to our generic T , ensuring that it does: # trait HasArea {\n# fn area(&self) -> f64;\n# }\nfn print_area<T: HasArea>(shape: T) { println!(\"This shape has an area of {}\", shape.area());\n} The syntax <T: HasArea> means “any type that implements the HasArea trait.” Because traits define function type signatures, we can be sure that any type which implements HasArea will have an .area() method. Here’s an extended example of how this works: trait HasArea { fn area(&self) -> f64;\n} struct Circle { x: f64, y: f64, radius: f64,\n} impl HasArea for Circle { fn area(&self) -> f64 { std::f64::consts::PI * (self.radius * self.radius) }\n} struct Square { x: f64, y: f64, side: f64,\n} impl HasArea for Square { fn area(&self) -> f64 { self.side * self.side }\n} fn print_area<T: HasArea>(shape: T) { println!(\"This shape has an area of {}\", shape.area());\n} fn main() { let c = Circle { x: 0.0f64, y: 0.0f64, radius: 1.0f64, }; let s = Square { x: 0.0f64, y: 0.0f64, side: 1.0f64, }; print_area(c); print_area(s);\n} This program outputs: This shape has an area of 3.141593\nThis shape has an area of 1 As you can see, print_area is now generic, but also ensures that we have passed in the correct types.

It improves on current languages targeting this space by having a number of compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while eliminating all data races.

Of course, not all file names have a . in them, so it's possible that the file name has no extension. This possibility of absence is encoded into the types using Option<T> . In other words, the compiler will force us to address the possibility that an extension does not exist. In our case, we only print out a message saying as such. Getting the extension of a file name is a pretty common operation, so it makes sense to put it into a function: # fn find(haystack: &str, needle: char) -> Option<usize> { haystack.find(needle) }\n// Returns the extension of the given file name, where the extension is defined\n// as all characters following the first `.`.\n// If `file_name` has no `.`, then `None` is returned.\nfn extension_explicit(file_name: &str) -> Option<&str> { match find(file_name, '.') { None => None, Some(i) => Some(&file_name[i+1..]), }\n} (Pro-tip: don't use this code. Use the extension method in the standard library instead.) The code stays simple, but the important thing to notice is that the type of find forces us to consider the possibility of absence. This is a good thing because it means the compiler won't let us accidentally forget about the case where a file name doesn't have an extension. On the other hand, doing explicit case analysis like we've done in extension_explicit every time can get a bit tiresome. In fact, the case analysis in extension_explicit follows a very common pattern: map a function on to the value inside of an Option<T> , unless the option is None , in which case, return None . Rust has parametric polymorphism, so it is very easy to define a combinator that abstracts this pattern: fn map<F, T, A>(option: Option<T>, f: F) -> Option<A> where F: FnOnce(T) -> A { match option { None => None, Some(value) => Some(f(value)), }\n} Indeed, map is defined as a method on Option<T> in the standard library. As a method, it has a slightly different signature: methods take self , &self , or &mut self as their first argument. Armed with our new combinator, we can rewrite our extension_explicit method to get rid of the case analysis: # fn find(haystack: &str, needle: char) -> Option<usize> { haystack.find(needle) }\n// Returns the extension of the given file name, where the extension is defined\n// as all characters following the first `.`.\n// If `file_name` has no `.`, then `None` is returned.\nfn extension(file_name: &str) -> Option<&str> { find(file_name, '.').map(|i| &file_name[i+1..])\n} One other pattern we commonly find is assigning a default value to the case when an Option value is None . For example, maybe your program assumes that the extension of a file is rs even if none is present. As you might imagine, the case analysis for this is not specific to file extensions - it can work with any Option<T> : fn unwrap_or<T>(option: Option<T>, default: T) -> T { match option { None => default, Some(value) => value, }\n} Like with map above, the standard library implementation is a method instead of a free function. The trick here is that the default value must have the same type as the value that might be inside the Option<T> . Using it is dead simple in our case: # fn find(haystack: &str, needle: char) -> Option<usize> {\n# for (offset, c) in haystack.char_indices() {\n# if c == needle {\n# return Some(offset);\n# }\n# }\n# None\n# }\n#\n# fn extension(file_name: &str) -> Option<&str> {\n# find(file_name, '.').map(|i| &file_name[i+1..])\n# }\nfn main() { assert_eq!(extension(\"foobar.csv\").unwrap_or(\"rs\"), \"csv\"); assert_eq!(extension(\"foobar\").unwrap_or(\"rs\"), \"rs\");\n} (Note that unwrap_or is defined as a method on Option<T> in the standard library, so we use that here instead of the free-standing function we defined above. Don't forget to check out the more general unwrap_or_else method.) There is one more combinator that we think is worth paying special attention to: and_then . It makes it easy to compose distinct computations that admit the possibility of absence . For example, much of the code in this section is about finding an extension given a file name. In order to do this, you first need the file name which is typically extracted from a file path . While most file paths have a file name, not all of them do. For example, . , .. or / . So, we are tasked with the challenge of finding an extension given a file path . Let's start with explicit case analysis: # fn extension(file_name: &str) -> Option<&str> { None }\nfn file_path_ext_explicit(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> { match file_name(file_path) { None => None, Some(name) => match extension(name) { None => None, Some(ext) => Some(ext), } }\n} fn file_name(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> { // Implementation elided. unimplemented!()\n} You might think that we could use the map combinator to reduce the case analysis, but its type doesn't quite fit... fn file_path_ext(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> { file_name(file_path).map(|x| extension(x)) // This causes a compilation error.\n} The map function here wraps the value returned by the extension function inside an Option<_> and since the extension function itself returns an Option<&str> the expression file_name(file_path).map(|x| extension(x)) actually returns an Option<Option<&str>> . But since file_path_ext just returns Option<&str> (and not Option<Option<&str>> ) we get a compilation error. The result of the function taken by map as input is always rewrapped with Some . Instead, we need something like map , but which allows the caller to return a Option<_> directly without wrapping it in another Option<_> . Its generic implementation is even simpler than map : fn and_then<F, T, A>(option: Option<T>, f: F) -> Option<A> where F: FnOnce(T) -> Option<A> { match option { None => None, Some(value) => f(value), }\n} Now we can rewrite our file_path_ext function without explicit case analysis: # fn extension(file_name: &str) -> Option<&str> { None }\n# fn file_name(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> { None }\nfn file_path_ext(file_path: &str) -> Option<&str> { file_name(file_path).and_then(extension)\n} Side note: Since and_then essentially works like map but returns an Option<_> instead of an Option<Option<_>> it is known as flatmap in some other languages. The Option type has many other combinators defined in the standard library . It is a good idea to skim this list and familiarize yourself with what's available—they can often reduce case analysis for you. Familiarizing yourself with these combinators will pay dividends because many of them are also defined (with similar semantics) for Result , which we will talk about next.

We won't go into too much detail on Getopts, but there is some good documentation describing it. The short story is that Getopts generates an argument parser and a help message from a vector of options (The fact that it is a vector is hidden behind a struct and a set of methods). Once the parsing is done, the parser returns a struct that records matches for defined options, and remaining \"free\" arguments. From there, we can get information about the flags, for instance, whether they were passed in, and what arguments they had. Here's our program with the appropriate extern crate statements, and the basic argument setup for Getopts: extern crate getopts;\nextern crate rustc_serialize; use getopts::Options;\nuse std::env; fn print_usage(program: &str, opts: Options) { println!(\"{}\", opts.usage(&format!(\"Usage: {} [options] <data-path> <city>\", program)));\n} fn main() { let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect(); let program = &args[0]; let mut opts = Options::new(); opts.optflag(\"h\", \"help\", \"Show this usage message.\"); let matches = match opts.parse(&args[1..]) { Ok(m) => { m } Err(e) => { panic!(e.to_string()) } }; if matches.opt_present(\"h\") { print_usage(&program, opts); return; } let data_path = &matches.free[0]; let city: &str = &matches.free[1]; // Do stuff with information.\n} First, we get a vector of the arguments passed into our program. We then store the first one, knowing that it is our program's name. Once that's done, we set up our argument flags, in this case a simplistic help message flag. Once we have the argument flags set up, we use Options.parse to parse the argument vector (starting from index one, because index 0 is the program name). If this was successful, we assign matches to the parsed object, if not, we panic. Once past that, we test if the user passed in the help flag, and if so print the usage message. The option help messages are constructed by Getopts, so all we have to do to print the usage message is tell it what we want it to print for the program name and template. If the user has not passed in the help flag, we assign the proper variables to their corresponding arguments."},"associated-types.html#associated-types":{"body":"Associated types are a powerful part of Rust’s type system. They’re related to the idea of a ‘type family’, in other words, grouping multiple types together. That description is a bit abstract, so let’s dive right into an example. If you want to write a Graph trait, you have two types to be generic over: the node type and the edge type. So you might write a trait, Graph<N, E> , that looks like this: trait Graph<N, E> { fn has_edge(&self, &N, &N) -> bool; fn edges(&self, &N) -> Vec<E>; // Etc.\n} While this sort of works, it ends up being awkward. For example, any function that wants to take a Graph as a parameter now also needs to be generic over the N ode and E dge types too: fn distance<N, E, G: Graph<N, E>>(graph: &G, start: &N, end: &N) -> u32 { ... } Our distance calculation works regardless of our Edge type, so the E stuff in this signature is a distraction. What we really want to say is that a certain E dge and N ode type come together to form each kind of Graph . We can do that with associated types: trait Graph { type N; type E; fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool; fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>; // Etc.\n} Now, our clients can be abstract over a given Graph : fn distance<G: Graph>(graph: &G, start: &G::N, end: &G::N) -> u32 { ... } No need to deal with the E dge type here!

Rust understands a few of these types, but they have some restrictions. There are three: We can only manipulate an instance of an unsized type via a pointer. An &[T] works fine, but a [T] does not. Variables and arguments cannot have dynamically sized types. Only the last field in a struct may have a dynamically sized type; the other fields must not. Enum variants must not have dynamically sized types as data. So why bother? Well, because [T] can only be used behind a pointer, if we didn’t have language support for unsized types, it would be impossible to write this: impl Foo for str { or impl<T> Foo for [T] { Instead, you would have to write: impl Foo for &str { Meaning, this implementation would only work for references , and not other types of pointers.

But we can splice in bits of syntax captured by the matcher.

The repetition in the expansion proceeds in \"lockstep\" with repetition in the matcher (more on this in a moment). Because $x was already declared as matching an expression, we don’t repeat :expr on the right-hand side. Also, we don’t include a separating comma as part of the repetition operator. Instead, we have a terminating semicolon within the repeated block. Another detail: the vec! macro has two pairs of braces on the right-hand side. They are often combined like so: macro_rules! foo { () => {{ ... }}\n} The outer braces are part of the syntax of macro_rules! . In fact, you can use () or [] instead. They simply delimit the right-hand side as a whole. The inner braces are part of the expanded syntax. Remember, the vec! macro is used in an expression context. To write an expression with multiple statements, including let -bindings, we use a block. If your macro expands to a single expression, you don’t need this extra layer of braces. Note that we never declared that the macro produces an expression. In fact, this is not determined until we use the macro as an expression.

For example, shorthand for a data type could be valid as either an expression or a pattern.","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Expansion","title":"Expansion"},"structs.html#structs":{"body":"struct s are a way of creating more complex data types. For example, if we were doing calculations involving coordinates in 2D space, we would need both an x and a y value: let origin_x = 0;\nlet origin_y = 0; A struct lets us combine these two into a single, unified datatype with x and y as field labels: struct Point { x: i32, y: i32,\n} fn main() { let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 }; // origin: Point println!(\"The origin is at ({}, {})\", origin.x, origin.y);\n} There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. We declare a struct with the struct keyword, and then with a name. By convention, struct s begin with a capital letter and are camel cased: PointInSpace , not Point_In_Space . We can create an instance of our struct via let , as usual, but we use a key: value style syntax to set each field. The order doesn’t need to be the same as in the original declaration. Finally, because fields have names, we can access them through dot notation: origin.x . The values in struct s are immutable by default, like other bindings in Rust. Use mut to make them mutable: struct Point { x: i32, y: i32,\n} fn main() { let mut point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 }; point.x = 5; println!(\"The point is at ({}, {})\", point.x, point.y);\n} This will print The point is at (5, 0) . Rust does not support field mutability at the language level, so you cannot write something like this: struct Point { mut x: i32, // This causes an error. y: i32,\n} Mutability is a property of the binding, not of the structure itself. If you’re used to field-level mutability, this may seem strange at first, but it significantly simplifies things. It even lets you make things mutable on a temporary basis: struct Point { x: i32, y: i32,\n} fn main() { let mut point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 }; point.x = 5; let point = point; // `point` is now immutable. point.y = 6; // This causes an error.\n} Your structure can still contain &mut references, which will let you do some kinds of mutation: struct Point { x: i32, y: i32,\n} struct PointRef<'a> { x: &'a mut i32, y: &'a mut i32,\n} fn main() { let mut point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 }; { let r = PointRef { x: &mut point.x, y: &mut point.y }; *r.x = 5; *r.y = 6; } assert_eq!(5, point.x); assert_eq!(6, point.y);\n} Initialization of a data structure (struct, enum, union) can be simplified when fields of the data structure are initialized with variables of the same names as the fields. #[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Person<'a> { name: &'a str, age: u8\n} fn main() { // Create struct with field init shorthand let name = \"Peter\"; let age = 27; let peter = Person { name, age }; // Debug-print struct println!(\"{:?}\", peter);\n}","title":"Structs","id":"structs.html#structs","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Structs"},"casting-between-types.html#as":{"title":"as","id":"casting-between-types.html#as","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » as","body":"The as keyword does safe casting: let x: i32 = 5; let y = x as i64; There are three major categories of safe cast: explicit coercions, casts between numeric types, and pointer casts.

Someone once said this: Shared mutable state is the root of all evil. Most languages attempt to deal with this problem through the 'mutable' part, but Rust deals with it by solving the 'shared' part. The same ownership system that helps prevent using pointers incorrectly also helps rule out data races, one of the worst kinds of concurrency bugs. As an example, here is a Rust program that would have a data race in many languages. It will not compile: use std::thread;\nuse std::time::Duration; fn main() { let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3]; for i in 0..3 { thread::spawn(move || { data[0] += i; }); } thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));\n} This gives us an error: 8:17 error: capture of moved value: `data` data[0] += i; ^~~~ Rust knows this wouldn't be safe! If we had a reference to data in each thread, and the thread takes ownership of the reference, we'd have three owners! data gets moved out of main in the first call to spawn() , so subsequent calls in the loop cannot use this variable. So, we need some type that lets us have more than one owning reference to a value. Usually, we'd use Rc<T> for this, which is a reference counted type that provides shared ownership. It has some runtime bookkeeping that keeps track of the number of references to it, hence the \"reference count\" part of its name. Calling clone() on an Rc<T> will return a new owned reference and bump the internal reference count. We create one of these for each thread: use std::thread;\nuse std::time::Duration;\nuse std::rc::Rc; fn main() { let mut data = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]); for i in 0..3 { // Create a new owned reference: let data_ref = data.clone(); // Use it in a thread: thread::spawn(move || { data_ref[0] += i; }); } thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));\n} This won't work, however, and will give us the error: 13:9: 13:22 error: the trait bound `alloc::rc::Rc<collections::vec::Vec<i32>> : core::marker::Send` is not satisfied\n...\n13:9: 13:22 note: `alloc::rc::Rc<collections::vec::Vec<i32>>` cannot be sent between threads safely As the error message mentions, Rc cannot be sent between threads safely. This is because the internal reference count is not maintained in a thread-safe manner and can have a data race. To solve this, we'll use Arc<T> , Rust's standard atomic reference count type. The Atomic part means Arc<T> can safely be accessed from multiple threads. To do this the compiler guarantees that mutations of the internal count use indivisible operations which can't have data races. In essence, Arc<T> is a type that lets us share ownership of data across threads . use std::thread;\nuse std::sync::Arc;\nuse std::time::Duration; fn main() { let mut data = Arc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]); for i in 0..3 { let data = data.clone(); thread::spawn(move || { data[0] += i; }); } thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));\n} Similarly to last time, we use clone() to create a new owned handle. This handle is then moved into the new thread. And... still gives us an error. <anon>:11:24 error: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content as mutable\n<anon>:11 data[0] += i; ^~~~ Arc<T> by default has immutable contents. It allows the sharing of data between threads, but shared mutable data is unsafe—and when threads are involved—can cause data races! Usually when we wish to make something in an immutable position mutable, we use Cell<T> or RefCell<T> which allow safe mutation via runtime checks or otherwise (see also: Choosing Your Guarantees ). However, similar to Rc , these are not thread-safe. If we try using these, we will get an error about these types not being Sync , and the code will fail to compile. It looks like we need some type that allows us to safely mutate a shared value across threads, for example a type that can ensure only one thread at a time is able to mutate the value inside it at any one time. For that, we can use the Mutex<T> type! Here's the working version: use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\nuse std::thread;\nuse std::time::Duration; fn main() { let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(vec![1, 2, 3])); for i in 0..3 { let data = data.clone(); thread::spawn(move || { let mut data = data.lock().unwrap(); data[0] += i; }); } thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));\n} Note that the value of i is bound (copied) to the closure and not shared among the threads. We're \"locking\" the mutex here. A mutex (short for \"mutual exclusion\"), as mentioned, only allows one thread at a time to access a value. When we wish to access the value, we use lock() on it. This will \"lock\" the mutex, and no other thread will be able to lock it (and hence, do anything with the value) until we're done with it. If a thread attempts to lock a mutex which is already locked, it will wait until the other thread releases the lock. The lock \"release\" here is implicit; when the result of the lock (in this case, data ) goes out of scope, the lock is automatically released. Note that lock method of Mutex has this signature: fn lock(&self) -> LockResult<MutexGuard<T>> and because Send is not implemented for MutexGuard<T> , the guard cannot cross thread boundaries, ensuring thread-locality of lock acquire and release. Let's examine the body of the thread more closely: # use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\n# use std::thread;\n# use std::time::Duration;\n# fn main() {\n# let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(vec![1, 2, 3]));\n# for i in 0..3 {\n# let data = data.clone();\nthread::spawn(move || { let mut data = data.lock().unwrap(); data[0] += i;\n});\n# }\n# thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));\n# } First, we call lock() , which acquires the mutex's lock. Because this may fail, it returns a Result<T, E> , and because this is just an example, we unwrap() it to get a reference to the data. Real code would have more robust error handling here. We're then free to mutate it, since we have the lock. Lastly, while the threads are running, we wait on a short timer. But this is not ideal: we may have picked a reasonable amount of time to wait but it's more likely we'll either be waiting longer than necessary or not long enough, depending on just how much time the threads actually take to finish computing when the program runs. A more precise alternative to the timer would be to use one of the mechanisms provided by the Rust standard library for synchronizing threads with each other.

First, both extern crate and use allow renaming the thing that is being imported. So the crate is still called \"phrases\", but here we will refer to it as \"sayings\". Similarly, the first use statement pulls in the japanese::greetings module from the crate, but makes it available as ja_greetings as opposed to simply greetings . This can help to avoid ambiguity when importing similarly-named items from different places. The second use statement uses a star glob to bring in all public symbols from the sayings::japanese::farewells module. As you can see we can later refer to the Japanese goodbye function with no module qualifiers. This kind of glob should be used sparingly. It’s worth noting that it only imports the public symbols, even if the code doing the globbing is in the same module. The third use statement bears more explanation. It's using \"brace expansion\" globbing to compress three use statements into one (this sort of syntax may be familiar if you've written Linux shell scripts before). The uncompressed form of this statement would be: use sayings::english;\nuse sayings::english::greetings as en_greetings;\nuse sayings::english::farewells as en_farewells; As you can see, the curly brackets compress use statements for several items under the same path, and in this context self refers back to that path.

But sometimes, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. Look at what we just did in the previous step: Defined a new error type. Added impls for Error , Display and two for From . The big downside here is that our program didn't improve a whole lot. There is quite a bit of overhead to representing errors with enum s, especially in short programs like this. One useful aspect of using a custom error type like we've done here is that the main function can now choose to handle errors differently. Previously, with Box<Error> , it didn't have much of a choice: just print the message. We're still doing that here, but what if we wanted to, say, add a --quiet flag? The --quiet flag should silence any verbose output. Right now, if the program doesn't find a match, it will output a message saying so. This can be a little clumsy, especially if you intend for the program to be used in shell scripts. So let's start by adding the flags. Like before, we need to tweak the usage string and add a flag to the Option variable. Once we've done that, Getopts does the rest: ... let mut opts = Options::new(); opts.optopt(\"f\", \"file\", \"Choose an input file, instead of using STDIN.\", \"NAME\"); opts.optflag(\"h\", \"help\", \"Show this usage message.\"); opts.optflag(\"q\", \"quiet\", \"Silences errors and warnings.\");\n... Now we only need to implement our “quiet” functionality. This requires us to tweak the case analysis in main : use std::process;\n... match search(&data_path, city) { Err(CliError::NotFound) if matches.opt_present(\"q\") => process::exit(1), Err(err) => panic!(\"{}\", err), Ok(pops) => for pop in pops { println!(\"{}, {}: {:?}\", pop.city, pop.country, pop.count); } }\n... Certainly, we don't want to be quiet if there was an IO error or if the data failed to parse. Therefore, we use case analysis to check if the error type is NotFound and if --quiet has been enabled. If the search failed, we still quit with an exit code (following grep 's convention). If we had stuck with Box<Error> , then it would be pretty tricky to implement the --quiet functionality. This pretty much sums up our case study.

Going the opposite direction, from *const to a reference & , is not safe. A &T is always valid, and so, at a minimum, the raw pointer *const T has to point to a valid instance of type T . Furthermore, the resulting pointer must satisfy the aliasing and mutability laws of references. The compiler assumes these properties are true for any references, no matter how they are created, and so any conversion from raw pointers is asserting that they hold. The programmer must guarantee this. The recommended method for the conversion is: // Explicit cast:\nlet i: u32 = 1;\nlet p_imm: *const u32 = &i as *const u32; // Implicit coercion:\nlet mut m: u32 = 2;\nlet p_mut: *mut u32 = &mut m; unsafe { let ref_imm: &u32 = &*p_imm; let ref_mut: &mut u32 = &mut *p_mut;\n} The &*x dereferencing style is preferred to using a transmute .

The members of a tuple struct may be accessed by dot notation or destructuring let , just like regular tuples: # struct Color(i32, i32, i32);\n# struct Point(i32, i32, i32);\n# let black = Color(0, 0, 0);\n# let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);\nlet black_r = black.0;\nlet Point(_, origin_y, origin_z) = origin; Patterns like Point(_, origin_y, origin_z) are also used in match expressions . One case when a tuple struct is very useful is when it has only one element. We call this the ‘newtype’ pattern, because it allows you to create a new type that is distinct from its contained value and also expresses its own semantic meaning: struct Inches(i32); let length = Inches(10); let Inches(integer_length) = length;\nprintln!(\"length is {} inches\", integer_length); As above, you can extract the inner integer type through a destructuring let . In this case, the let Inches(integer_length) assigns 10 to integer_length . We could have used dot notation to do the same thing: # struct Inches(i32);\n# let length = Inches(10);\nlet integer_length = length.0; It's always possible to use a struct instead of a tuple struct, and can be clearer. We could write Color and Point like this instead: struct Color { red: i32, blue: i32, green: i32,\n} struct Point { x: i32, y: i32, z: i32,\n} Good names are important, and while values in a tuple struct can be referenced with dot notation as well, a struct gives us actual names, rather than positions."},"traits.html#trait-bounds-on-generic-structs":{"breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Trait bounds on generic structs","id":"traits.html#trait-bounds-on-generic-structs","body":"Your generic structs can also benefit from trait bounds.

Implementing the Error trait also means that users are guaranteed the ability to obtain a string representation of an error (because it requires impls for both fmt::Debug and fmt::Display ). Beyond that, it can also be useful to provide implementations of From on your error types. This allows you (the library author) and your users to compose more detailed errors .

Trait objects are both simple and complicated: their core representation and layout is quite straight-forward, but there are some curly error messages and surprising behaviors to discover. Let’s start simple, with the runtime representation of a trait object. The std::raw module contains structs with layouts that are the same as the complicated built-in types, including trait objects : # mod foo {\npub struct TraitObject { pub data: *mut (), pub vtable: *mut (),\n}\n# } That is, a trait object like &Foo consists of a ‘data’ pointer and a ‘vtable’ pointer. The data pointer addresses the data (of some unknown type T ) that the trait object is storing, and the vtable pointer points to the vtable (‘virtual method table’) corresponding to the implementation of Foo for T . A vtable is essentially a struct of function pointers, pointing to the concrete piece of machine code for each method in the implementation. A method call like trait_object.method() will retrieve the correct pointer out of the vtable and then do a dynamic call of it. For example: struct FooVtable { destructor: fn(*mut ()), size: usize, align: usize, method: fn(*const ()) -> String,\n} // u8: fn call_method_on_u8(x: *const ()) -> String { // The compiler guarantees that this function is only called // with `x` pointing to a u8. let byte: &u8 = unsafe { &*(x as *const u8) }; byte.method()\n} static Foo_for_u8_vtable: FooVtable = FooVtable { destructor: /* compiler magic */, size: 1, align: 1, // Cast to a function pointer: method: call_method_on_u8 as fn(*const ()) -> String,\n}; // String: fn call_method_on_String(x: *const ()) -> String { // The compiler guarantees that this function is only called // with `x` pointing to a String. let string: &String = unsafe { &*(x as *const String) }; string.method()\n} static Foo_for_String_vtable: FooVtable = FooVtable { destructor: /* compiler magic */, // Values for a 64-bit computer, halve them for 32-bit ones. size: 24, align: 8, method: call_method_on_String as fn(*const ()) -> String,\n}; The destructor field in each vtable points to a function that will clean up any resources of the vtable’s type: for u8 it is trivial, but for String it will free the memory. This is necessary for owning trait objects like Box<Foo> , which need to clean-up both the Box allocation as well as the internal type when they go out of scope.

You don't need to define your own error types and you don't need any From implementations. The downside is that since Box<Error> is a trait object, it erases the type , which means the compiler can no longer reason about its underlying type. Previously we started refactoring our code by changing the type of our function from T to Result<T, OurErrorType> . In this case, OurErrorType is only Box<Error> . But what's T ? And can we add a return type to main ? The answer to the second question is no, we can't. That means we'll need to write a new function. But what is T ? The simplest thing we can do is to return a list of matching Row values as a Vec<Row> . (Better code would return an iterator, but that is left as an exercise to the reader.) Let's refactor our code into its own function, but keep the calls to unwrap . Note that we opt to handle the possibility of a missing population count by simply ignoring that row. use std::path::Path; struct Row { // This struct remains unchanged.\n} struct PopulationCount { city: String, country: String, // This is no longer an `Option` because values of this type are only // constructed if they have a population count. count: u64,\n} fn print_usage(program: &str, opts: Options) { println!(\"{}\", opts.usage(&format!(\"Usage: {} [options] <data-path> <city>\", program)));\n} fn search<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P, city: &str) -> Vec<PopulationCount> { let mut found = vec![]; let file = File::open(file_path).unwrap(); let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(file); for row in rdr.decode::<Row>() { let row = row.unwrap(); match row.population { None => { } // Skip it. Some(count) => if row.city == city { found.push(PopulationCount { city: row.city, country: row.country, count: count, }); }, } } found\n} fn main() { let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect(); let program = &args[0]; let mut opts = Options::new(); opts.optflag(\"h\", \"help\", \"Show this usage message.\"); let matches = match opts.parse(&args[1..]) { Ok(m) => { m } Err(e) => { panic!(e.to_string()) } }; if matches.opt_present(\"h\") { print_usage(&program, opts); return; } let data_path = &matches.free[0]; let city: &str = &matches.free[1]; for pop in search(data_path, city) { println!(\"{}, {}: {:?}\", pop.city, pop.country, pop.count); }\n} While we got rid of one use of expect (which is a nicer variant of unwrap ), we still should handle the absence of any search results. To convert this to proper error handling, we need to do the following: Change the return type of search to be Result<Vec<PopulationCount>, Box<Error>> . Use the try! macro so that errors are returned to the caller instead of panicking the program. Handle the error in main . Let's try it: use std::error::Error; // The rest of the code before this is unchanged. fn search<P: AsRef<Path>> (file_path: P, city: &str) -> Result<Vec<PopulationCount>, Box<Error>> { let mut found = vec![]; let file = try!(File::open(file_path)); let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(file); for row in rdr.decode::<Row>() { let row = try!(row); match row.population { None => { } // Skip it. Some(count) => if row.city == city { found.push(PopulationCount { city: row.city, country: row.country, count: count, }); }, } } if found.is_empty() { Err(From::from(\"No matching cities with a population were found.\")) } else { Ok(found) }\n} Instead of x.unwrap() , we now have try!(x) . Since our function returns a Result<T, E> , the try! macro will return early from the function if an error occurs. At the end of search we also convert a plain string to an error type by using the corresponding From impls : // We are making use of this impl in the code above, since we call `From::from`\n// on a `&'static str`.\nimpl<'a> From<&'a str> for Box<Error> // But this is also useful when you need to allocate a new string for an\n// error message, usually with `format!`.\nimpl From<String> for Box<Error> Since search now returns a Result<T, E> , main should use case analysis when calling search : ... match search(data_path, city) { Ok(pops) => { for pop in pops { println!(\"{}, {}: {:?}\", pop.city, pop.country, pop.count); } } Err(err) => println!(\"{}\", err) }\n...

Here’s our next step, though it doesn’t quite compile yet: extern crate rand; use std::io;\nuse std::cmp::Ordering;\nuse rand::Rng; fn main() { println!(\"Guess the number!\"); let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); println!(\"The secret number is: {}\", secret_number); println!(\"Please input your guess.\"); let mut guess = String::new(); io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess) .expect(\"Failed to read line\"); println!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess); match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { Ordering::Less => println!(\"Too small!\"), Ordering::Greater => println!(\"Too big!\"), Ordering::Equal => println!(\"You win!\"), }\n} A few new bits here. The first is another use . We bring a type called std::cmp::Ordering into scope. Then, five new lines at the bottom that use it: match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { Ordering::Less => println!(\"Too small!\"), Ordering::Greater => println!(\"Too big!\"), Ordering::Equal => println!(\"You win!\"),\n} The cmp() method can be called on anything that can be compared, and it takes a reference to the thing you want to compare it to. It returns the Ordering type we use d earlier. We use a match statement to determine exactly what kind of Ordering it is. Ordering is an enum , short for ‘enumeration’, which looks like this: enum Foo { Bar, Baz,\n} With this definition, anything of type Foo can be either a Foo::Bar or a Foo::Baz . We use the :: to indicate the namespace for a particular enum variant. The Ordering enum has three possible variants: Less , Equal , and Greater . The match statement takes a value of a type, and lets you create an ‘arm’ for each possible value. Since we have three types of Ordering , we have three arms: match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { Ordering::Less => println!(\"Too small!\"), Ordering::Greater => println!(\"Too big!\"), Ordering::Equal => println!(\"You win!\"),\n} If it’s Less , we print Too small! , if it’s Greater , Too big! , and if Equal , You win! . match is really useful, and is used often in Rust. I did mention that this won’t quite compile yet, though. Let’s try it: $ cargo build Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types --> src/main.rs:23:21 |\n23 | match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected struct `std::string::String`, found integral variable | = note: expected type `&std::string::String` = note: found type `&{integer}` error: aborting due to previous error error: Could not compile `guessing_game`. To learn more, run the command again with --verbose. Whew! This is a big error. The core of it is that we have ‘mismatched types’. Rust has a strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote let guess = String::new() , Rust was able to infer that guess should be a String , and so it doesn’t make us write out the type. And with our secret_number , there are a number of types which can have a value between one and a hundred: i32 , a thirty-two-bit number, or u32 , an unsigned thirty-two-bit number, or i64 , a sixty-four-bit number or others. So far, that hasn’t mattered, and so Rust defaults to an i32 . However, here, Rust doesn’t know how to compare the guess and the secret_number . They need to be the same type. Ultimately, we want to convert the String we read as input into a real number type, for comparison. We can do that with two more lines. Here’s our new program: extern crate rand; use std::io;\nuse std::cmp::Ordering;\nuse rand::Rng; fn main() { println!(\"Guess the number!\"); let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); println!(\"The secret number is: {}\", secret_number); println!(\"Please input your guess.\"); let mut guess = String::new(); io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess) .expect(\"Failed to read line\"); let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse() .expect(\"Please type a number!\"); println!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess); match guess.cmp(&secret_number) { Ordering::Less => println!(\"Too small!\"), Ordering::Greater => println!(\"Too big!\"), Ordering::Equal => println!(\"You win!\"), }\n} The new two lines: let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse() .expect(\"Please type a number!\"); Wait a minute, I thought we already had a guess ? We do, but Rust allows us to ‘shadow’ the previous guess with a new one. This is often used in this exact situation, where guess starts as a String , but we want to convert it to an u32 . Shadowing lets us re-use the guess name, rather than forcing us to come up with two unique names like guess_str and guess , or something else. We bind guess to an expression that looks like something we wrote earlier: guess.trim().parse() Here, guess refers to the old guess , the one that was a String with our input in it. The trim() method on String s will eliminate any white space at the beginning and end of our string. This is important, as we had to press the ‘return’ key to satisfy read_line() . This means that if we type 5 and hit return, guess looks like this: 5\\n . The \\n represents ‘newline’, the enter key. trim() gets rid of this, leaving our string with only the 5 . The parse() method on strings parses a string into some kind of number. Since it can parse a variety of numbers, we need to give Rust a hint as to the exact type of number we want. Hence, let guess: u32 . The colon ( : ) after guess tells Rust we’re going to annotate its type. u32 is an unsigned, thirty-two bit integer. Rust has a number of built-in number types , but we’ve chosen u32 . It’s a good default choice for a small positive number. Just like read_line() , our call to parse() could cause an error. What if our string contained A👍% ? There’d be no way to convert that to a number. As such, we’ll do the same thing we did with read_line() : use the expect() method to crash if there’s an error.

However, it has a runtime cost. RefCell<T> enforces the read-write lock pattern at runtime (it's like a single-threaded mutex), unlike &T / &mut T which do so at compile time. This is done by the borrow() and borrow_mut() functions, which modify an internal reference count and return smart pointers which can be dereferenced immutably and mutably respectively. The refcount is restored when the smart pointers go out of scope. With this system, we can dynamically ensure that there are never any other borrows active when a mutable borrow is active. If the programmer attempts to make such a borrow, the thread will panic. use std::cell::RefCell; let x = RefCell::new(vec![1,2,3,4]);\n{ println!(\"{:?}\", *x.borrow())\n} { let mut my_ref = x.borrow_mut(); my_ref.push(1);\n} Similar to Cell , this is mainly useful for situations where it's hard or impossible to satisfy the borrow checker. Generally we know that such mutations won't happen in a nested form, but it's good to check. For large, complicated programs, it becomes useful to put some things in RefCell s to make things simpler. For example, a lot of the maps in the ctxt struct in the Rust compiler internals are inside this wrapper. These are only modified once (during creation, which is not right after initialization) or a couple of times in well-separated places. However, since this struct is pervasively used everywhere, juggling mutable and immutable pointers would be hard (perhaps impossible) and probably form a soup of & -ptrs which would be hard to extend. On the other hand, the RefCell provides a cheap (not zero-cost) way of safely accessing these. In the future, if someone adds some code that attempts to modify the cell when it's already borrowed, it will cause a (usually deterministic) panic which can be traced back to the offending borrow. Similarly, in Servo's DOM there is a lot of mutation, most of which is local to a DOM type, but some of which crisscrosses the DOM and modifies various things. Using RefCell and Cell to guard all mutation lets us avoid worrying about mutability everywhere, and it simultaneously highlights the places where mutation is actually happening. Note that RefCell should be avoided if a mostly simple solution is possible with & pointers. Guarantees RefCell relaxes the static restrictions preventing aliased mutation, and replaces them with dynamic ones. As such the guarantees have not changed. Cost RefCell does not allocate, but it contains an additional \"borrow state\" indicator (one word in size) along with the data.

( panic causes the current task to unwind, and in most cases, the entire program aborts.)

The first thing we need to do for our guessing game is allow our player to input a guess. Put this in your src/main.rs : use std::io; fn main() { println!(\"Guess the number!\"); println!(\"Please input your guess.\"); let mut guess = String::new(); io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess) .expect(\"Failed to read line\"); println!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess);\n} There’s a lot here! Let’s go over it, bit by bit. use std::io; We’ll need to take user input, and then print the result as output. As such, we need the io library from the standard library. Rust only imports a few things by default into every program, the ‘prelude’ . If it’s not in the prelude, you’ll have to use it directly. There is also a second ‘prelude’, the io prelude , which serves a similar function: you import it, and it imports a number of useful, io -related things. fn main() { As you’ve seen before, the main() function is the entry point into your program. The fn syntax declares a new function, the () s indicate that there are no arguments, and { starts the body of the function. Because we didn’t include a return type, it’s assumed to be () , an empty tuple . println!(\"Guess the number!\"); println!(\"Please input your guess.\"); We previously learned that println!() is a macro that prints a string to the screen. let mut guess = String::new(); Now we’re getting interesting! There’s a lot going on in this little line. The first thing to notice is that this is a let statement , which is used to create ‘variable bindings’. They take this form: let foo = bar; This will create a new binding named foo , and bind it to the value bar . In many languages, this is called a ‘variable’, but Rust’s variable bindings have a few tricks up their sleeves. For example, they’re immutable by default. That’s why our example uses mut : it makes a binding mutable, rather than immutable. let doesn’t take a name on the left hand side of the assignment, it actually accepts a ‘ pattern ’. We’ll use patterns later. It’s easy enough to use for now: let foo = 5; // `foo` is immutable.\nlet mut bar = 5; // `bar` is mutable. Oh, and // will start a comment, until the end of the line. Rust ignores everything in comments . So now we know that let mut guess will introduce a mutable binding named guess , but we have to look at the other side of the = for what it’s bound to: String::new() . String is a string type, provided by the standard library. A String is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text. The ::new() syntax uses :: because this is an ‘associated function’ of a particular type. That is to say, it’s associated with String itself, rather than a particular instance of a String . Some languages call this a ‘static method’. This function is named new() , because it creates a new, empty String . You’ll find a new() function on many types, as it’s a common name for making a new value of some kind. Let’s move forward: io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess) .expect(\"Failed to read line\"); That’s a lot more! Let’s go bit-by-bit. The first line has two parts. Here’s the first: io::stdin() Remember how we use d std::io on the first line of the program? We’re now calling an associated function on it. If we didn’t use std::io , we could have written this line as std::io::stdin() . This particular function returns a handle to the standard input for your terminal. More specifically, a std::io::Stdin . The next part will use this handle to get input from the user: .read_line(&mut guess) Here, we call the read_line method on our handle. Methods are like associated functions, but are only available on a particular instance of a type, rather than the type itself. We’re also passing one argument to read_line() : &mut guess . Remember how we bound guess above? We said it was mutable. However, read_line doesn’t take a String as an argument: it takes a &mut String . Rust has a feature called ‘ references ’, which allows you to have multiple references to one piece of data, which can reduce copying. References are a complex feature, as one of Rust’s major selling points is how safe and easy it is to use references. We don’t need to know a lot of those details to finish our program right now, though. For now, all we need to know is that like let bindings, references are immutable by default. Hence, we need to write &mut guess , rather than &guess . Why does read_line() take a mutable reference to a string? Its job is to take what the user types into standard input, and place that into a string. So it takes that string as an argument, and in order to add the input, it needs to be mutable. But we’re not quite done with this line of code, though. While it’s a single line of text, it’s only the first part of the single logical line of code: .expect(\"Failed to read line\"); When you call a method with the .foo() syntax, you may introduce a newline and other whitespace. This helps you split up long lines. We could have done: io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect(\"Failed to read line\"); But that gets hard to read. So we’ve split it up, two lines for two method calls. We already talked about read_line() , but what about expect() ? Well, we already mentioned that read_line() puts what the user types into the &mut String we pass it. But it also returns a value: in this case, an io::Result . Rust has a number of types named Result in its standard library: a generic Result , and then specific versions for sub-libraries, like io::Result . The purpose of these Result types is to encode error handling information. Values of the Result type, like any type, have methods defined on them. In this case, io::Result has an expect() method that takes a value it’s called on, and if it isn’t a successful one, panic! s with a message you passed it. A panic! like this will cause our program to crash, displaying the message. If we do not call expect() , our program will compile, but we’ll get a warning: $ cargo build Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game)\nwarning: unused result which must be used, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default --> src/main.rs:10:5 |\n10 | io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess); | ^ Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42 secs Rust warns us that we haven’t used the Result value. This warning comes from a special annotation that io::Result has. Rust is trying to tell you that you haven’t handled a possible error. The right way to suppress the error is to actually write error handling. Luckily, if we want to crash if there’s a problem, we can use expect() . If we can recover from the error somehow, we’d do something else, but we’ll save that for a future project. There’s only one line of this first example left: println!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess);\n} This prints out the string we saved our input in. The {} s are a placeholder, and so we pass it guess as an argument. If we had multiple {} s, we would pass multiple arguments: let x = 5;\nlet y = 10; println!(\"x and y: {} and {}\", x, y); Easy. Anyway, that’s the tour.

Instead of expressing the possibility of absence like Option does, Result expresses the possibility of error . Usually, the error is used to explain why the execution of some computation failed. This is a strictly more general form of Option . Consider the following type alias, which is semantically equivalent to the real Option<T> in every way: type Option<T> = Result<T, ()>; This fixes the second type parameter of Result to always be () (pronounced “unit” or “empty tuple”). Exactly one value inhabits the () type: () . (Yup, the type and value level terms have the same notation!) The Result type is a way of representing one of two possible outcomes in a computation. By convention, one outcome is meant to be expected or “ Ok ” while the other outcome is meant to be unexpected or “ Err ”. Just like Option , the Result type also has an unwrap method defined in the standard library. Let's define it: # enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E) }\nimpl<T, E: ::std::fmt::Debug> Result<T, E> { fn unwrap(self) -> T { match self { Result::Ok(val) => val, Result::Err(err) => panic!(\"called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: {:?}\", err), } }\n} This is effectively the same as our definition for Option::unwrap , except it includes the error value in the panic! message. This makes debugging easier, but it also requires us to add a Debug constraint on the E type parameter (which represents our error type). Since the vast majority of types should satisfy the Debug constraint, this tends to work out in practice.

The iterator gives back a series of elements, one element per iteration of the loop. That value is then bound to the name var , which is valid for the loop body. Once the body is over, the next value is fetched from the iterator, and we loop another time. When there are no more values, the for loop is over. In our example, 0..10 is an expression that takes a start and an end position, and gives an iterator over those values.

For example, imagine this set of operations: I acquire a handle to some kind of resource. I lend you a reference to the resource. I decide I’m done with the resource, and deallocate it, while you still have your reference. You decide to use the resource. Uh oh! Your reference is pointing to an invalid resource. This is called a dangling pointer or ‘use after free’, when the resource is memory. A small example of such a situation would be: let r; // Introduce reference: `r`.\n{ let i = 1; // Introduce scoped value: `i`. r = &i; // Store reference of `i` in `r`.\n} // `i` goes out of scope and is dropped. println!(\"{}\", r); // `r` still refers to `i`. To fix this, we have to make sure that step four never happens after step three. In the small example above the Rust compiler is able to report the issue as it can see the lifetimes of the various values in the function. When we have a function that takes arguments by reference the situation becomes more complex. Consider the following example: fn skip_prefix(line: &str, prefix: &str) -> &str { // ...\n# line\n} let line = \"lang:en=Hello World!\";\nlet lang = \"en\"; let v;\n{ let p = format!(\"lang:{}=\", lang); // -+ `p` comes into scope. v = skip_prefix(line, p.as_str()); // |\n} // -+ `p` goes out of scope.\nprintln!(\"{}\", v); Here we have a function skip_prefix which takes two &str references as parameters and returns a single &str reference. We call it by passing in references to line and p : Two variables with different lifetimes. Now the safety of the println! -line depends on whether the reference returned by skip_prefix function references the still living line or the already dropped p string. Because of the above ambiguity, Rust will refuse to compile the example code. To get it to compile we need to tell the compiler more about the lifetimes of the references. This can be done by making the lifetimes explicit in the function declaration: fn skip_prefix<'a, 'b>(line: &'a str, prefix: &'b str) -> &'a str { // ...\n# line\n} Let's examine the changes without going too deep into the syntax for now - we'll get to that later. The first change was adding the <'a, 'b> after the method name. This introduces two lifetime parameters: 'a and 'b . Next, each reference in the function signature was associated with one of the lifetime parameters by adding the lifetime name after the & . This tells the compiler how the lifetimes between different references are related. As a result the compiler is now able to deduce that the return value of skip_prefix has the same lifetime as the line parameter, which makes the v reference safe to use even after the p goes out of scope in the original example. In addition to the compiler being able to validate the usage of skip_prefix return value, it can also ensure that the implementation follows the contract established by the function declaration. This is useful especially when you are implementing traits that are introduced later in the book . Note It's important to understand that lifetime annotations are descriptive , not prescriptive . This means that how long a reference is valid is determined by the code, not by the annotations. The annotations, however, give information about lifetimes to the compiler that uses them to check the validity of references. The compiler can do so without annotations in simple cases, but needs the programmer's support in complex scenarios.","title":"Lifetimes","id":"lifetimes.html#lifetimes"},"choosing-your-guarantees.html#composition":{"breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » Composition","title":"Composition","id":"choosing-your-guarantees.html#composition","body":"A common gripe when reading Rust code is with types like Rc<RefCell<Vec<T>>> (or even more complicated compositions of such types). It's not always clear what the composition does, or why the author chose one like this (and when one should be using such a composition in one's own code) Usually, it's a case of composing together the guarantees that you need, without paying for stuff that is unnecessary. For example, Rc<RefCell<T>> is one such composition. Rc<T> itself can't be dereferenced mutably; because Rc<T> provides sharing and shared mutability can lead to unsafe behavior, so we put RefCell<T> inside to get dynamically verified shared mutability. Now we have shared mutable data, but it's shared in a way that there can only be one mutator (and no readers) or multiple readers. Now, we can take this a step further, and have Rc<RefCell<Vec<T>>> or Rc<Vec<RefCell<T>>> . These are both shareable, mutable vectors, but they're not the same. With the former, the RefCell<T> is wrapping the Vec<T> , so the Vec<T> in its entirety is mutable. At the same time, there can only be one mutable borrow of the whole Vec at a given time. This means that your code cannot simultaneously work on different elements of the vector from different Rc handles. However, we are able to push and pop from the Vec<T> at will. This is similar to a &mut Vec<T> with the borrow checking done at runtime. With the latter, the borrowing is of individual elements, but the overall vector is immutable. Thus, we can independently borrow separate elements, but we cannot push or pop from the vector. This is similar to a &mut [T] [2] , but, again, the borrow checking is at runtime. In concurrent programs, we have a similar situation with Arc<Mutex<T>> , which provides shared mutability and ownership. When reading code that uses these, go in step by step and look at the guarantees/costs provided. When choosing a composed type, we must do the reverse; figure out which guarantees we want, and at which point of the composition we need them. For example, if there is a choice between Vec<RefCell<T>> and RefCell<Vec<T>> , we should figure out the trade-offs as done above and pick one. &[T] and &mut [T] are slices ; they consist of a pointer and a length and can refer to a portion of a vector or array. &mut [T] can have its elements mutated, however its length cannot be touched."},"macros.html#macros":{"title":"Macros","id":"macros.html#macros","body":"By now you’ve learned about many of the tools Rust provides for abstracting and reusing code. These units of code reuse have a rich semantic structure. For example, functions have a type signature, type parameters have trait bounds, and overloaded functions must belong to a particular trait. This structure means that Rust’s core abstractions have powerful compile-time correctness checking. But this comes at the price of reduced flexibility. If you visually identify a pattern of repeated code, you may find it’s difficult or cumbersome to express that pattern as a generic function, a trait, or anything else within Rust’s semantics. Macros allow us to abstract at a syntactic level. A macro invocation is shorthand for an \"expanded\" syntactic form. This expansion happens early in compilation, before any static checking. As a result, macros can capture many patterns of code reuse that Rust’s core abstractions cannot. The drawback is that macro-based code can be harder to understand, because fewer of the built-in rules apply. Like an ordinary function, a well-behaved macro can be used without understanding its implementation. However, it can be difficult to design a well-behaved macro! Additionally, compiler errors in macro code are harder to interpret, because they describe problems in the expanded code, not the source-level form that developers use. These drawbacks make macros something of a \"feature of last resort\".

The bounds are getting in the way. Rust has a solution, and it’s called a ‘ where clause’: use std::fmt::Debug; fn foo<T: Clone, K: Clone + Debug>(x: T, y: K) { x.clone(); y.clone(); println!(\"{:?}\", y);\n} fn bar<T, K>(x: T, y: K) where T: Clone, K: Clone + Debug { x.clone(); y.clone(); println!(\"{:?}\", y);\n} fn main() { foo(\"Hello\", \"world\"); bar(\"Hello\", \"world\");\n} foo() uses the syntax we showed earlier, and bar() uses a where clause. All you need to do is leave off the bounds when defining your type parameters, and then add where after the parameter list. For longer lists, whitespace can be added: use std::fmt::Debug; fn bar<T, K>(x: T, y: K) where T: Clone, K: Clone + Debug { x.clone(); y.clone(); println!(\"{:?}\", y);\n} This flexibility can add clarity in complex situations. where is also more powerful than the simpler syntax.

We previously talked a little about function syntax , but we didn’t discuss the <> s after a function’s name. A function can have ‘generic parameters’ between the <> s, of which lifetimes are one kind. We’ll discuss other kinds of generics later in the book , but for now, let’s focus on the lifetimes aspect. We use <> to declare our lifetimes. This says that bar has one lifetime, 'a . If we had two reference parameters with different lifetimes, it would look like this: fn bar<'a, 'b>(...) Then in our parameter list, we use the lifetimes we’ve named: ...(x: &'a i32) If we wanted a &mut reference, we’d do this: ...(x: &'a mut i32) If you compare &mut i32 to &'a mut i32 , they’re the same, it’s that the lifetime 'a has snuck in between the & and the mut i32 . We read &mut i32 as ‘a mutable reference to an i32 ’ and &'a mut i32 as ‘a mutable reference to an i32 with the lifetime 'a ’.","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Syntax","id":"lifetimes.html#syntax","title":"Syntax"},"guessing-game.html#set-up":{"id":"guessing-game.html#set-up","title":"Set up","breadcrumbs":"Set up","body":"Let’s set up a new project.

For example, this C program prints 13 instead of the expected 25 . #define FIVE_TIMES(x) 5 * x int main() { printf(\"%d\\n\", FIVE_TIMES(2 + 3)); return 0;\n} After expansion we have 5 * 2 + 3 , and multiplication has greater precedence than addition. If you’ve used C macros a lot, you probably know the standard idioms for avoiding this problem, as well as five or six others. In Rust, we don’t have to worry about it. macro_rules! five_times { ($x:expr) => (5 * $x);\n} fn main() { assert_eq!(25, five_times!(2 + 3));\n} The metavariable $x is parsed as a single expression node, and keeps its place in the syntax tree even after substitution. Another common problem in macro systems is ‘variable capture’. Here’s a C macro using a block with multiple statements. #define LOG(msg) do { \\ int state = get_log_state(); \\ if (state > 0) { \\ printf(\"log(%d): %s\\n\", state, msg); \\ } \\\n} while (0) Here’s a simple use case that goes terribly wrong: const char *state = \"reticulating splines\";\nLOG(state); This expands to const char *state = \"reticulating splines\";\ndo { int state = get_log_state(); if (state > 0) { printf(\"log(%d): %s\\n\", state, state); }\n} while (0); The second variable named state shadows the first one. This is a problem because the print statement should refer to both of them. The equivalent Rust macro has the desired behavior. # fn get_log_state() -> i32 { 3 }\nmacro_rules! log { ($msg:expr) => {{ let state: i32 = get_log_state(); if state > 0 { println!(\"log({}): {}\", state, $msg); } }};\n} fn main() { let state: &str = \"reticulating splines\"; log!(state);\n} This works because Rust has a hygienic macro system . Each macro expansion happens in a distinct ‘syntax context’, and each variable is tagged with the syntax context where it was introduced. It’s as though the variable state inside main is painted a different \"color\" from the variable state inside the macro, and therefore they don’t conflict. This also restricts the ability of macros to introduce new bindings at the invocation site. Code such as the following will not work: macro_rules! foo { () => (let x = 3;);\n} fn main() { foo!(); println!(\"{}\", x);\n} Instead you need to pass the variable name into the invocation, so that it’s tagged with the right syntax context. macro_rules! foo { ($v:ident) => (let $v = 3;);\n} fn main() { foo!(x); println!(\"{}\", x);\n} This holds for let bindings and loop labels, but not for items .

Even the deallocation of a uniquely-owned heap-allocated box can be driven by the stack-based LIFO semantics, as discussed throughout this chapter. The flexibility (i.e. expressiveness) of non LIFO-semantics means that in general the compiler cannot automatically infer at compile-time where memory should be freed; it has to rely on dynamic protocols, potentially from outside the language itself, to drive deallocation (reference counting, as used by Rc<T> and Arc<T> , is one example of this).

You do not pay any run-time cost for any of these features. However, this system does have a certain cost: learning curve. Many new users to Rust experience something we like to call ‘fighting with the borrow checker’, where the Rust compiler refuses to compile a program that the author thinks is valid. This often happens because the programmer’s mental model of how ownership should work doesn’t match the actual rules that Rust implements. You probably will experience similar things at first. There is good news, however: more experienced Rust developers report that once they work with the rules of the ownership system for a period of time, they fight the borrow checker less and less.

Each variant in the enum can optionally have data associated with it: enum Message { Quit, ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32), Move { x: i32, y: i32 }, Write(String),\n} The syntax for defining variants resembles the syntaxes used to define structs: you can have variants with no data (like unit-like structs), variants with named data, and variants with unnamed data (like tuple structs). Unlike separate struct definitions, however, an enum is a single type. A value of the enum can match any of the variants. For this reason, an enum is sometimes called a ‘sum type’: the set of possible values of the enum is the sum of the sets of possible values for each variant. We use the :: syntax to use the name of each variant: they’re scoped by the name of the enum itself. This allows both of these to work: # enum Message {\n# Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\n# }\nlet x: Message = Message::Move { x: 3, y: 4 }; enum BoardGameTurn { Move { squares: i32 }, Pass,\n} let y: BoardGameTurn = BoardGameTurn::Move { squares: 1 }; Both variants are named Move , but since they’re scoped to the name of the enum, they can both be used without conflict. A value of an enum type contains information about which variant it is, in addition to any data associated with that variant. This is sometimes referred to as a ‘tagged union’, since the data includes a ‘tag’ indicating what type it is. The compiler uses this information to enforce that you’re accessing the data in the enum safely. For instance, you can’t simply try to destructure a value as if it were one of the possible variants: fn process_color_change(msg: Message) { let Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) = msg; // This causes a compile-time error.\n} Not supporting these operations may seem rather limiting, but it’s a limitation which we can overcome. There are two ways: by implementing equality ourselves, or by pattern matching variants with match expressions, which you’ll learn in the next section. We don’t know enough about Rust to implement equality yet, but we’ll find out in the traits section."},"iterators.html#consumers":{"breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » Consumers","body":"A consumer operates on an iterator, returning some kind of value or values. The most common consumer is collect() . This code doesn't quite compile, but it shows the intention: let one_to_one_hundred = (1..101).collect(); As you can see, we call collect() on our iterator. collect() takes as many values as the iterator will give it, and returns a collection of the results. So why won't this compile? Rust can't determine what type of things you want to collect, and so you need to let it know. Here's the version that does compile: let one_to_one_hundred = (1..101).collect::<Vec<i32>>(); If you remember, the ::<> syntax allows us to give a type hint that tells the compiler we want a vector of integers. You don't always need to use the whole type, though. Using a _ will let you provide a partial hint: let one_to_one_hundred = (1..101).collect::<Vec<_>>(); This says \"Collect into a Vec<T> , please, but infer what the T is for me.\" _ is sometimes called a \"type placeholder\" for this reason. collect() is the most common consumer, but there are others too. find() is one: let greater_than_forty_two = (0..100) .find(|x| *x > 42); match greater_than_forty_two { Some(_) => println!(\"Found a match!\"), None => println!(\"No match found :(\"),\n} find takes a closure, and works on a reference to each element of an iterator. This closure returns true if the element is the element we're looking for, and false otherwise. find returns the first element satisfying the specified predicate. Because we might not find a matching element, find returns an Option rather than the element itself. Another important consumer is fold . Here's what it looks like: let sum = (1..4).fold(0, |sum, x| sum + x); fold() is a consumer that looks like this: fold(base, |accumulator, element| ...) . It takes two arguments: the first is an element called the base . The second is a closure that itself takes two arguments: the first is called the accumulator , and the second is an element . Upon each iteration, the closure is called, and the result is the value of the accumulator on the next iteration. On the first iteration, the base is assigned the value of the accumulator. Okay, that's a bit confusing. Let's examine the values of all of these things in this iterator: base accumulator element closure result 0 0 1 1 0 1 2 3 0 3 3 6 We called fold() with these arguments: # (1..4)\n.fold(0, |sum, x| sum + x); So, 0 is our base, sum is our accumulator, and x is our element. On the first iteration, we set sum to 0 , and x is the first element of nums , 1 . We then add sum and x , which gives us 0 + 1 = 1 . On the second iteration, that value becomes our accumulator, sum , and the element is the second element of the array, 2 . 1 + 2 = 3 , and so that becomes the value of the accumulator for the last iteration. On that iteration, x is the last element, 3 , and 3 + 3 = 6 , which is our final result for our sum. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 , and that's the result we got. Whew. fold can be a bit strange the first few times you see it, but once it clicks, you can use it all over the place. Any time you have a list of things, and you want a single result, fold is appropriate. Consumers are important due to one additional property of iterators we haven't talked about yet: laziness. Let's talk some more about iterators, and you'll see why consumers matter.","title":"Consumers","id":"iterators.html#consumers"},"references-and-borrowing.html#iterator-invalidation":{"id":"references-and-borrowing.html#iterator-invalidation","body":"One example is ‘iterator invalidation’, which happens when you try to mutate a collection that you’re iterating over.

Each ‘arm’ of the branch is of the form val => expression . When the value matches, that arm’s expression will be evaluated. It’s called match because of the term ‘pattern matching’, which match is an implementation of. There’s a separate section on patterns that covers all the patterns that are possible here. One of the many advantages of match is it enforces ‘exhaustiveness checking’. For example if we remove the last arm with the underscore _ , the compiler will give us an error: error: non-exhaustive patterns: `_` not covered Rust is telling us that we forgot some value. The compiler infers from x that it can have any 32bit integer value; for example -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. The _ acts as a 'catch-all', and will catch all possible values that aren't specified in an arm of match . As you can see in the previous example, we provide match arms for integers 1-5, if x is 6 or any other value, then it is caught by _ . match is also an expression, which means we can use it on the right-hand side of a let binding or directly where an expression is used: let x = 5; let number = match x { 1 => \"one\", 2 => \"two\", 3 => \"three\", 4 => \"four\", 5 => \"five\", _ => \"something else\",\n}; Sometimes it’s a nice way of converting something from one type to another; in this example the integers are converted to String .","title":"Match","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Match","id":"match.html#match"},"error-handling.html#defining-your-own-error-type":{"breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » Defining your own error type","body":"Before we dive into some of the standard library error traits, I'd like to wrap up this section by removing the use of String as our error type in the previous examples. Using String as we did in our previous examples is convenient because it's easy to convert errors to strings, or even make up your own errors as strings on the spot. However, using String for your errors has some downsides. The first downside is that the error messages tend to clutter your code. It's possible to define the error messages elsewhere, but unless you're unusually disciplined, it is very tempting to embed the error message into your code. Indeed, we did exactly this in a previous example . The second and more important downside is that String s are lossy . That is, if all errors are converted to strings, then the errors we pass to the caller become completely opaque. The only reasonable thing the caller can do with a String error is show it to the user. Certainly, inspecting the string to determine the type of error is not robust. (Admittedly, this downside is far more important inside of a library as opposed to, say, an application.) For example, the io::Error type embeds an io::ErrorKind , which is structured data that represents what went wrong during an IO operation. This is important because you might want to react differently depending on the error. (e.g., A BrokenPipe error might mean quitting your program gracefully while a NotFound error might mean exiting with an error code and showing an error to the user.) With io::ErrorKind , the caller can examine the type of an error with case analysis, which is strictly superior to trying to tease out the details of an error inside of a String . Instead of using a String as an error type in our previous example of reading an integer from a file, we can define our own error type that represents errors with structured data . We endeavor to not drop information from underlying errors in case the caller wants to inspect the details. The ideal way to represent one of many possibilities is to define our own sum type using enum . In our case, an error is either an io::Error or a num::ParseIntError , so a natural definition arises: use std::io;\nuse std::num; // We derive `Debug` because all types should probably derive `Debug`.\n// This gives us a reasonable human-readable description of `CliError` values.\n#[derive(Debug)]\nenum CliError { Io(io::Error), Parse(num::ParseIntError),\n} Tweaking our code is very easy. Instead of converting errors to strings, we simply convert them to our CliError type using the corresponding value constructor: # #[derive(Debug)]\n# enum CliError { Io(::std::io::Error), Parse(::std::num::ParseIntError) }\nuse std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::Read;\nuse std::path::Path; fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, CliError> { let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path).map_err(CliError::Io)); let mut contents = String::new(); try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents).map_err(CliError::Io)); let n: i32 = try!(contents.trim().parse().map_err(CliError::Parse)); Ok(2 * n)\n} fn main() { match file_double(\"foobar\") { Ok(n) => println!(\"{}\", n), Err(err) => println!(\"Error: {:?}\", err), }\n} The only change here is switching map_err(|e| e.to_string()) (which converts errors to strings) to map_err(CliError::Io) or map_err(CliError::Parse) . The caller gets to decide the level of detail to report to the user. In effect, using a String as an error type removes choices from the caller while using a custom enum error type like CliError gives the caller all of the conveniences as before in addition to structured data describing the error. A rule of thumb is to define your own error type, but a String error type will do in a pinch, particularly if you're writing an application. If you're writing a library, defining your own error type should be strongly preferred so that you don't remove choices from the caller unnecessarily.","id":"error-handling.html#defining-your-own-error-type","title":"Defining your own error type"},"associated-types.html#implementing-associated-types":{"id":"associated-types.html#implementing-associated-types","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Implementing associated types","title":"Implementing associated types","body":"Just like any trait, traits that use associated types use the impl keyword to provide implementations.

It's so easy in fact, that it is very tempting to write something like the following: fn double_number(number_str: &str) -> i32 { 2 * number_str.parse::<i32>().unwrap()\n} fn main() { let n: i32 = double_number(\"10\"); assert_eq!(n, 20);\n} At this point, you should be skeptical of calling unwrap . For example, if the string doesn't parse as a number, you'll get a panic: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: ParseIntError { kind: InvalidDigit }', /home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/beta-dist-rustc-linux/build/src/libcore/result.rs:729 This is rather unsightly, and if this happened inside a library you're using, you might be understandably annoyed. Instead, we should try to handle the error in our function and let the caller decide what to do. This means changing the return type of double_number . But to what? Well, that requires looking at the signature of the parse method in the standard library: impl str { fn parse<F: FromStr>(&self) -> Result<F, F::Err>;\n} Hmm. So we at least know that we need to use a Result . Certainly, it's possible that this could have returned an Option . After all, a string either parses as a number or it doesn't, right? That's certainly a reasonable way to go, but the implementation internally distinguishes why the string didn't parse as an integer. (Whether it's an empty string, an invalid digit, too big or too small.) Therefore, using a Result makes sense because we want to provide more information than simply “absence.” We want to say why the parsing failed. You should try to emulate this line of reasoning when faced with a choice between Option and Result . If you can provide detailed error information, then you probably should. (We'll see more on this later.) OK, but how do we write our return type? The parse method as defined above is generic over all the different number types defined in the standard library. We could (and probably should) also make our function generic, but let's favor explicitness for the moment. We only care about i32 , so we need to find its implementation of FromStr (do a CTRL-F in your browser for “FromStr”) and look at its associated type Err . We did this so we can find the concrete error type. In this case, it's std::num::ParseIntError . Finally, we can rewrite our function: use std::num::ParseIntError; fn double_number(number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> { match number_str.parse::<i32>() { Ok(n) => Ok(2 * n), Err(err) => Err(err), }\n} fn main() { match double_number(\"10\") { Ok(n) => assert_eq!(n, 20), Err(err) => println!(\"Error: {:?}\", err), }\n} This is a little better, but now we've written much more code! The case analysis has once again bitten us. Combinators to the rescue! Just like Option , Result has lots of combinators defined as methods. There is a large intersection of common combinators between Result and Option . In particular, map is part of that intersection: use std::num::ParseIntError; fn double_number(number_str: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> { number_str.parse::<i32>().map(|n| 2 * n)\n} fn main() { match double_number(\"10\") { Ok(n) => assert_eq!(n, 20), Err(err) => println!(\"Error: {:?}\", err), }\n} The usual suspects are all there for Result , including unwrap_or and and_then . Additionally, since Result has a second type parameter, there are combinators that affect only the error type, such as map_err (instead of map ) and or_else (instead of and_then ).","id":"error-handling.html#parsing-integers","title":"Parsing integers"},"method-syntax.html#chaining-method-calls":{"id":"method-syntax.html#chaining-method-calls","title":"Chaining method calls","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Chaining method calls","body":"So, now we know how to call a method, such as foo.bar() .

(self - other).abs() <= ::std::f32::EPSILON }\n} println!(\"{}\", 1.0.approx_equal(&1.00000001)); This may seem like the Wild West, but there are two restrictions around implementing traits that prevent this from getting out of hand. The first is that if the trait isn’t defined in your scope, it doesn’t apply. Here’s an example: the standard library provides a Write trait which adds extra functionality to File s, for doing file I/O. By default, a File won’t have its methods: let mut f = std::fs::File::create(\"foo.txt\").expect(\"Couldn’t create foo.txt\");\nlet buf = b\"whatever\"; // buf: &[u8; 8], a byte string literal.\nlet result = f.write(buf);\n# result.unwrap(); // Ignore the error. Here’s the error: error: type `std::fs::File` does not implement any method in scope named `write`\nlet result = f.write(buf); ^~~~~~~~~~ We need to use the Write trait first: use std::io::Write; let mut f = std::fs::File::create(\"foo.txt\").expect(\"Couldn’t create foo.txt\");\nlet buf = b\"whatever\";\nlet result = f.write(buf);\n# result.unwrap(); // Ignore the error. This will compile without error. This means that even if someone does something bad like add methods to i32 , it won’t affect you, unless you use that trait. There’s one more restriction on implementing traits: either the trait or the type you’re implementing it for must be defined by you. Or more precisely, one of them must be defined in the same crate as the impl you're writing. For more on Rust's module and package system, see the chapter on crates and modules . So, we could implement the HasArea type for i32 , because we defined HasArea in our code. But if we tried to implement ToString , a trait provided by Rust, for i32 , we could not, because neither the trait nor the type are defined in our crate.

This means we probably should be able to accept input on stdin. But maybe we like the current format too—so let's have both! Adding support for stdin is actually quite easy. There are only three things we have to do: Tweak the program arguments so that a single parameter—the city—can be accepted while the population data is read from stdin. Modify the program so that an option -f can take the file, if it is not passed into stdin. Modify the search function to take an optional file path. When None , it should know to read from stdin. First, here's the new usage: fn print_usage(program: &str, opts: Options) { println!(\"{}\", opts.usage(&format!(\"Usage: {} [options] <city>\", program)));\n} Of course we need to adapt the argument handling code: ... let mut opts = Options::new(); opts.optopt(\"f\", \"file\", \"Choose an input file, instead of using STDIN.\", \"NAME\"); opts.optflag(\"h\", \"help\", \"Show this usage message.\"); ... let data_path = matches.opt_str(\"f\"); let city = if !matches.free.is_empty() { &matches.free[0] } else { print_usage(&program, opts); return; }; match search(&data_path, city) { Ok(pops) => { for pop in pops { println!(\"{}, {}: {:?}\", pop.city, pop.country, pop.count); } } Err(err) => println!(\"{}\", err) }\n... We've made the user experience a bit nicer by showing the usage message, instead of a panic from an out-of-bounds index, when city , the remaining free argument, is not present. Modifying search is slightly trickier. The csv crate can build a parser out of any type that implements io::Read . But how can we use the same code over both types? There's actually a couple ways we could go about this. One way is to write search such that it is generic on some type parameter R that satisfies io::Read . Another way is to use trait objects: use std::io; // The rest of the code before this is unchanged. fn search<P: AsRef<Path>> (file_path: &Option<P>, city: &str) -> Result<Vec<PopulationCount>, Box<Error>> { let mut found = vec![]; let input: Box<io::Read> = match *file_path { None => Box::new(io::stdin()), Some(ref file_path) => Box::new(try!(File::open(file_path))), }; let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(input); // The rest remains unchanged!\n}","id":"error-handling.html#reading-from-stdin","title":"Reading from stdin"},"macros.html#assert-and-assert_eq":{"breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » assert! and assert_eq!","title":"assert! and assert_eq!","body":"These two macros are used in tests. assert! takes a boolean. assert_eq! takes two values and checks them for equality. true passes, false panic! s.

However, for ergonomic reasons, a very restricted secondary inference algorithm called “lifetime elision” does apply when judging lifetimes. Lifetime elision is concerned solely with inferring lifetime parameters using three easily memorizable and unambiguous rules. This means lifetime elision acts as a shorthand for writing an item signature, while not hiding away the actual types involved as full local inference would if applied to it. When talking about lifetime elision, we use the terms input lifetime and output lifetime . An input lifetime is a lifetime associated with a parameter of a function, and an output lifetime is a lifetime associated with the return value of a function. For example, this function has an input lifetime: fn foo<'a>(bar: &'a str) This one has an output lifetime: fn foo<'a>() -> &'a str This one has a lifetime in both positions: fn foo<'a>(bar: &'a str) -> &'a str Here are the three rules: Each elided lifetime in a function’s arguments becomes a distinct lifetime parameter. If there is exactly one input lifetime, elided or not, that lifetime is assigned to all elided lifetimes in the return values of that function. If there are multiple input lifetimes, but one of them is &self or &mut self , the lifetime of self is assigned to all elided output lifetimes. Otherwise, it is an error to elide an output lifetime.","id":"lifetimes.html#lifetime-elision","title":"Lifetime Elision","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Lifetime Elision"},"documentation.html#documentation-as-tests":{"body":"Let's discuss our sample example documentation: /// ```\n/// println!(\"Hello, world\");\n/// ```\n# fn foo() {} You'll notice that you don't need a fn main() or anything here. rustdoc will automatically add a main() wrapper around your code, using heuristics to attempt to put it in the right place. For example: /// ```\n/// use std::rc::Rc;\n///\n/// let five = Rc::new(5);\n/// ```\n# fn foo() {} This will end up testing: fn main() { use std::rc::Rc; let five = Rc::new(5);\n} Here's the full algorithm rustdoc uses to preprocess examples: Any leading #![foo] attributes are left intact as crate attributes. Some common allow attributes are inserted, including unused_variables , unused_assignments , unused_mut , unused_attributes , and dead_code . Small examples often trigger these lints. If the example does not contain extern crate , then extern crate <mycrate>; is inserted (note the lack of #[macro_use] ). Finally, if the example does not contain fn main , the remainder of the text is wrapped in fn main() { your_code } . This generated fn main can be a problem! If you have extern crate or a mod statements in the example code that are referred to by use statements, they will fail to resolve unless you include at least fn main() {} to inhibit step 4. #[macro_use] extern crate also does not work except at the crate root, so when testing macros an explicit main is always required. It doesn't have to clutter up your docs, though -- keep reading! Sometimes this algorithm isn't enough, though. For example, all of these code samples with /// we've been talking about? The raw text: /// Some documentation.\n# fn foo() {} looks different than the output: /// Some documentation.\n# fn foo() {} Yes, that's right: you can add lines that start with # , and they will be hidden from the output, but will be used when compiling your code. You can use this to your advantage. In this case, documentation comments need to apply to some kind of function, so if I want to show you just a documentation comment, I need to add a little function definition below it. At the same time, it's only there to satisfy the compiler, so hiding it makes the example more clear. You can use this technique to explain longer examples in detail, while still preserving the testability of your documentation. For example, imagine that we wanted to document this code: let x = 5;\nlet y = 6;\nprintln!(\"{}\", x + y); We might want the documentation to end up looking like this: First, we set x to five: let x = 5;\n# let y = 6;\n# println!(\"{}\", x + y); Next, we set y to six: # let x = 5;\nlet y = 6;\n# println!(\"{}\", x + y); Finally, we print the sum of x and y : # let x = 5;\n# let y = 6;\nprintln!(\"{}\", x + y); To keep each code block testable, we want the whole program in each block, but we don't want the reader to see every line every time. Here's what we put in our source code: First, we set `x` to five: ```rust let x = 5; # let y = 6; # println!(\"{}\", x + y); ``` Next, we set `y` to six: ```rust # let x = 5; let y = 6; # println!(\"{}\", x + y); ``` Finally, we print the sum of `x` and `y`: ```rust # let x = 5; # let y = 6; println!(\"{}\", x + y); ``` By repeating all parts of the example, you can ensure that your example still compiles, while only showing the parts that are relevant to that part of your explanation.","id":"documentation.html#documentation-as-tests","breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » Documentation as tests","title":"Documentation as tests"},"references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing":{"id":"references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » References and Borrowing","title":"References and Borrowing","body":"This is the second of three sections presenting Rust’s ownership system.

In particular, we converted errors to Box<Error> , which works, but the type is opaque to callers. To fix this, we use the same remedy that we're already familiar with: a custom error type. Once again, here is the code that reads the contents of a file and converts it to an integer: use std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::{self, Read};\nuse std::num;\nuse std::path::Path; // We derive `Debug` because all types should probably derive `Debug`.\n// This gives us a reasonable human-readable description of `CliError` values.\n#[derive(Debug)]\nenum CliError { Io(io::Error), Parse(num::ParseIntError),\n} fn file_double_verbose<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, CliError> { let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path).map_err(CliError::Io)); let mut contents = String::new(); try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents).map_err(CliError::Io)); let n: i32 = try!(contents.trim().parse().map_err(CliError::Parse)); Ok(2 * n)\n} Notice that we still have the calls to map_err . Why? Well, recall the definitions of try! and From . The problem is that there is no From impl that allows us to convert from error types like io::Error and num::ParseIntError to our own custom CliError . Of course, it is easy to fix this! Since we defined CliError , we can impl From with it: # #[derive(Debug)]\n# enum CliError { Io(io::Error), Parse(num::ParseIntError) }\nuse std::io;\nuse std::num; impl From<io::Error> for CliError { fn from(err: io::Error) -> CliError { CliError::Io(err) }\n} impl From<num::ParseIntError> for CliError { fn from(err: num::ParseIntError) -> CliError { CliError::Parse(err) }\n} All these impls are doing is teaching From how to create a CliError from other error types. In our case, construction is as simple as invoking the corresponding value constructor. Indeed, it is typically this easy. We can finally rewrite file_double : # use std::io;\n# use std::num;\n# enum CliError { Io(::std::io::Error), Parse(::std::num::ParseIntError) }\n# impl From<io::Error> for CliError {\n# fn from(err: io::Error) -> CliError { CliError::Io(err) }\n# }\n# impl From<num::ParseIntError> for CliError {\n# fn from(err: num::ParseIntError) -> CliError { CliError::Parse(err) }\n# } use std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::Read;\nuse std::path::Path; fn file_double<P: AsRef<Path>>(file_path: P) -> Result<i32, CliError> { let mut file = try!(File::open(file_path)); let mut contents = String::new(); try!(file.read_to_string(&mut contents)); let n: i32 = try!(contents.trim().parse()); Ok(2 * n)\n} The only thing we did here was remove the calls to map_err . They are no longer needed because the try! macro invokes From::from on the error value. This works because we've provided From impls for all the error types that could appear. If we modified our file_double function to perform some other operation, say, convert a string to a float, then we'd need to add a new variant to our error type: use std::io;\nuse std::num; enum CliError { Io(io::Error), ParseInt(num::ParseIntError), ParseFloat(num::ParseFloatError),\n} And add a new From impl: # enum CliError {\n# Io(::std::io::Error),\n# ParseInt(num::ParseIntError),\n# ParseFloat(num::ParseFloatError),\n# } use std::num; impl From<num::ParseFloatError> for CliError { fn from(err: num::ParseFloatError) -> CliError { CliError::ParseFloat(err) }\n} And that's it!","title":"Composing custom error types"},"bibliography.html#papers--about--rust":{"id":"bibliography.html#papers--about--rust","body":"GPU Programming in Rust: Implementing High Level Abstractions in a Systems Level Language .

The ownership system is a prime example of a zero-cost abstraction. All of the analysis we’ll talk about in this guide is done at compile time . You do not pay any run-time cost for any of these features. However, this system does have a certain cost: learning curve. Many new users to Rust experience something we like to call ‘fighting with the borrow checker’, where the Rust compiler refuses to compile a program that the author thinks is valid. This often happens because the programmer’s mental model of how ownership should work doesn’t match the actual rules that Rust implements. You probably will experience similar things at first. There is good news, however: more experienced Rust developers report that once they work with the rules of the ownership system for a period of time, they fight the borrow checker less and less.

In Rust, we can do this with generics. Generics are called ‘parametric polymorphism’ in type theory, which means that they are types or functions that have multiple forms (‘poly’ is multiple, ‘morph’ is form) over a given parameter (‘parametric’). Anyway, enough type theory, let’s check out some generic code. Rust’s standard library provides a type, Option<T> , that’s generic: enum Option<T> { Some(T), None,\n} The <T> part, which you’ve seen a few times before, indicates that this is a generic data type. Inside the declaration of our enum , wherever we see a T , we substitute that type for the same type used in the generic. Here’s an example of using Option<T> , with some extra type annotations: let x: Option<i32> = Some(5); In the type declaration, we say Option<i32> . Note how similar this looks to Option<T> . So, in this particular Option , T has the value of i32 . On the right-hand side of the binding, we make a Some(T) , where T is 5 . Since that’s an i32 , the two sides match, and Rust is happy. If they didn’t match, we’d get an error: let x: Option<f64> = Some(5);\n// error: mismatched types: expected `core::option::Option<f64>`,\n// found `core::option::Option<_>` (expected f64 but found integral variable) That doesn’t mean we can’t make Option<T> s that hold an f64 ! They have to match up: let x: Option<i32> = Some(5);\nlet y: Option<f64> = Some(5.0f64); This is just fine. One definition, multiple uses. Generics don’t have to only be generic over one type. Consider another type from Rust’s standard library that’s similar, Result<T, E> : enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E),\n} This type is generic over two types: T and E . By the way, the capital letters can be any letter you’d like. We could define Result<T, E> as: enum Result<A, Z> { Ok(A), Err(Z),\n} if we wanted to. Convention says that the first generic parameter should be T , for ‘type’, and that we use E for ‘error’. Rust doesn’t care, however. The Result<T, E> type is intended to be used to return the result of a computation, and to have the ability to return an error if it didn’t work out.","id":"generics.html#generics"},"borrow-and-asref.html#borrow":{"title":"Borrow","breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » Borrow","body":"The Borrow trait is used when you’re writing a data structure, and you want to use either an owned or borrowed type as synonymous for some purpose. For example, HashMap has a get method which uses Borrow : fn get<Q: ?Sized>(&self, k: &Q) -> Option<&V> where K: Borrow<Q>, Q: Hash + Eq This signature is pretty complicated. The K parameter is what we’re interested in here. It refers to a parameter of the HashMap itself: struct HashMap<K, V, S = RandomState> { The K parameter is the type of key the HashMap uses. So, looking at the signature of get() again, we can use get() when the key implements Borrow<Q> . That way, we can make a HashMap which uses String keys, but use &str s when we’re searching: use std::collections::HashMap; let mut map = HashMap::new();\nmap.insert(\"Foo\".to_string(), 42); assert_eq!(map.get(\"Foo\"), Some(&42)); This is because the standard library has impl Borrow<str> for String . For most types, when you want to take an owned or borrowed type, a &T is enough. But one area where Borrow is effective is when there’s more than one kind of borrowed value. This is especially true of references and slices: you can have both an &T or a &mut T . If we wanted to accept both of these types, Borrow is up for it: use std::borrow::Borrow;\nuse std::fmt::Display; fn foo<T: Borrow<i32> + Display>(a: T) { println!(\"a is borrowed: {}\", a);\n} let mut i = 5; foo(&i);\nfoo(&mut i); This will print out a is borrowed: 5 twice.","id":"borrow-and-asref.html#borrow"},"strings.html#strings":{"body":"Strings are an important concept for any programmer to master. Rust’s string handling system is a bit different from other languages, due to its systems focus. Any time you have a data structure of variable size, things can get tricky, and strings are a re-sizable data structure. That being said, Rust’s strings also work differently than in some other systems languages, such as C. Let’s dig into the details. A ‘string’ is a sequence of Unicode scalar values encoded as a stream of UTF-8 bytes. All strings are guaranteed to be a valid encoding of UTF-8 sequences. Additionally, unlike some systems languages, strings are not NUL-terminated and can contain NUL bytes. Rust has two main types of strings: &str and String . Let’s talk about &str first. These are called ‘string slices’. A string slice has a fixed size, and cannot be mutated. It is a reference to a sequence of UTF-8 bytes. let greeting = \"Hello there.\"; // greeting: &'static str \"Hello there.\" is a string literal and its type is &'static str . A string literal is a string slice that is statically allocated, meaning that it’s saved inside our compiled program, and exists for the entire duration it runs. The greeting binding is a reference to this statically allocated string. Any function expecting a string slice will also accept a string literal. String literals can span multiple lines. There are two forms. The first will include the newline and the leading spaces: let s = \"foo bar\"; assert_eq!(\"foo\\n bar\", s); The second, with a \\ , trims the spaces and the newline: let s = \"foo\\ bar\"; assert_eq!(\"foobar\", s); Note that you normally cannot access a str directly, but only through a &str reference. This is because str is an unsized type which requires additional runtime information to be usable. For more information see the chapter on unsized types . Rust has more than only &str s though. A String is a heap-allocated string. This string is growable, and is also guaranteed to be UTF-8. String s are commonly created by converting from a string slice using the to_string method. let mut s = \"Hello\".to_string(); // mut s: String\nprintln!(\"{}\", s); s.push_str(\", world.\");\nprintln!(\"{}\", s); String s will coerce into &str with an & : fn takes_slice(slice: &str) { println!(\"Got: {}\", slice);\n} fn main() { let s = \"Hello\".to_string(); takes_slice(&s);\n} This coercion does not happen for functions that accept one of &str ’s traits instead of &str . For example, TcpStream::connect has a parameter of type ToSocketAddrs . A &str is okay but a String must be explicitly converted using &* . use std::net::TcpStream; TcpStream::connect(\"192.168.0.1:3000\"); // Parameter is of type &str. let addr_string = \"192.168.0.1:3000\".to_string();\nTcpStream::connect(&*addr_string); // Convert `addr_string` to &str. Viewing a String as a &str is cheap, but converting the &str to a String involves allocating memory. No reason to do that unless you have to!","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Strings","id":"strings.html#strings","title":"Strings"},"references-and-borrowing.html#thinking-in-scopes":{"breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Thinking in scopes","title":"Thinking in scopes","body":"Here’s the code: fn main() { let mut x = 5; let y = &mut x; *y += 1; println!(\"{}\", x);\n} This code gives us this error: error: cannot borrow `x` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable println!(\"{}\", x); ^ This is because we’ve violated the rules: we have a &mut T pointing to x , and so we aren’t allowed to create any &T s. It's one or the other. The note hints at how to think about this problem: note: previous borrow ends here\nfn main() { }\n^ In other words, the mutable borrow is held through the rest of our example. What we want is for the mutable borrow by y to end so that the resource can be returned to the owner, x . x can then provide an immutable borrow to println! . In Rust, borrowing is tied to the scope that the borrow is valid for. And our scopes look like this: fn main() { let mut x = 5; let y = &mut x; // -+ &mut borrow of `x` starts here. // | *y += 1; // | // | println!(\"{}\", x); // -+ - Try to borrow `x` here.\n} // -+ &mut borrow of `x` ends here. The scopes conflict: we can’t make an &x while y is in scope.

The simplest one is called map : (1..100).map(|x| x + 1); map is called upon another iterator, and produces a new iterator where each element reference has the closure it's been given as an argument called on it. So this would give us the numbers from 2-100 . Well, almost! If you compile the example, you'll get a warning: warning: unused result which must be used: iterator adaptors are lazy and do nothing unless consumed, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default\n(1..100).map(|x| x + 1); ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Laziness strikes again! That closure will never execute. This example doesn't print any numbers: (1..100).map(|x| println!(\"{}\", x)); If you are trying to execute a closure on an iterator for its side effects, use for instead. There are tons of interesting iterator adaptors. take(n) will return an iterator over the next n elements of the original iterator. Let's try it out with an infinite iterator: for i in (1..).take(5) { println!(\"{}\", i);\n} This will print 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 filter() is an adapter that takes a closure as an argument. This closure returns true or false . The new iterator filter() produces only the elements that the closure returns true for: for i in (1..100).filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0) { println!(\"{}\", i);\n} This will print all of the even numbers between one and a hundred. (Note that, unlike map , the closure passed to filter is passed a reference to the element instead of the element itself. The filter predicate here uses the &x pattern to extract the integer. The filter closure is passed a reference because it returns true or false instead of the element, so the filter implementation must retain ownership to put the elements into the newly constructed iterator.) You can chain all three things together: start with an iterator, adapt it a few times, and then consume the result. Check it out: (1..) .filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0) .filter(|&x| x % 3 == 0) .take(5) .collect::<Vec<i32>>(); This will give you a vector containing 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , and 30 .

But since Fn is a trait, it could be various things of various sizes: many different types can implement Fn . An easy way to give something a size is to take a reference to it, as references have a known size. So we’d write this: fn factory() -> &(Fn(i32) -> i32) { let num = 5; |x| x + num\n} let f = factory(); let answer = f(1);\nassert_eq!(6, answer); But we get another error: error: missing lifetime specifier [E0106]\nfn factory() -> &(Fn(i32) -> i32) { ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Right. Because we have a reference, we need to give it a lifetime. But our factory() function takes no arguments, so elision doesn’t kick in here. Then what choices do we have? Try 'static : fn factory() -> &'static (Fn(i32) -> i32) { let num = 5; |x| x + num\n} let f = factory(); let answer = f(1);\nassert_eq!(6, answer); But we get another error: error: mismatched types: expected `&'static core::ops::Fn(i32) -> i32`, found `[closure@<anon>:7:9: 7:20]`\n(expected &-ptr, found closure) [E0308] |x| x + num ^~~~~~~~~~~ This error is letting us know that we don’t have a &'static Fn(i32) -> i32 , we have a [closure@<anon>:7:9: 7:20] . Wait, what? Because each closure generates its own environment struct and implementation of Fn and friends, these types are anonymous. They exist solely for this closure. So Rust shows them as closure@<anon> , rather than some autogenerated name. The error also points out that the return type is expected to be a reference, but what we are trying to return is not. Further, we cannot directly assign a 'static lifetime to an object. So we'll take a different approach and return a ‘trait object’ by Box ing up the Fn . This almost works: fn factory() -> Box<Fn(i32) -> i32> { let num = 5; Box::new(|x| x + num)\n} let f = factory(); let answer = f(1);\nassert_eq!(6, answer); There’s just one last problem: error: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `num`,\nwhich is owned by the current function [E0373]\nBox::new(|x| x + num) ^~~~~~~~~~~ Well, as we discussed before, closures borrow their environment. And in this case, our environment is based on a stack-allocated 5 , the num variable binding. So the borrow has a lifetime of the stack frame. So if we returned this closure, the function call would be over, the stack frame would go away, and our closure is capturing an environment of garbage memory! With one last fix, we can make this work: fn factory() -> Box<Fn(i32) -> i32> { let num = 5; Box::new(move |x| x + num)\n} let f = factory(); let answer = f(1);\nassert_eq!(6, answer); By making the inner closure a move Fn , we create a new stack frame for our closure. By Box ing it up, we’ve given it a known size, allowing it to escape our stack frame.","title":"Returning closures"},"if-let.html#if-let":{"id":"if-let.html#if-let","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » if let","body":"if let permits patterns matching within the condition of an if statement.

That looks like this: # let option = Some(5);\n# fn foo(x: i32) { }\nmatch option { Some(x) => { foo(x) }, None => {},\n} We don’t have to use match here, for example, we could use if : # let option = Some(5);\n# fn foo(x: i32) { }\nif option.is_some() { let x = option.unwrap(); foo(x);\n} Neither of these options is particularly appealing.

You do not pay any run-time cost for any of these features. However, this system does have a certain cost: learning curve. Many new users to Rust experience something we like to call ‘fighting with the borrow checker’, where the Rust compiler refuses to compile a program that the author thinks is valid. This often happens because the programmer’s mental model of how ownership should work doesn’t match the actual rules that Rust implements. You probably will experience similar things at first. There is good news, however: more experienced Rust developers report that once they work with the rules of the ownership system for a period of time, they fight the borrow checker less and less.

This means that Rust will create a special version of do_something() for both u8 and String , and then replace the call sites with calls to these specialized functions. In other words, Rust generates something like this: # trait Foo { fn method(&self) -> String; }\n# impl Foo for u8 { fn method(&self) -> String { format!(\"u8: {}\", *self) } }\n# impl Foo for String { fn method(&self) -> String { format!(\"string: {}\", *self) } }\nfn do_something_u8(x: u8) { x.method();\n} fn do_something_string(x: String) { x.method();\n} fn main() { let x = 5u8; let y = \"Hello\".to_string(); do_something_u8(x); do_something_string(y);\n} This has a great upside: static dispatch allows function calls to be inlined because the callee is known at compile time, and inlining is the key to good optimization. Static dispatch is fast, but it comes at a tradeoff: ‘code bloat’, due to many copies of the same function existing in the binary, one for each type. Furthermore, compilers aren’t perfect and may “optimize” code to become slower. For example, functions inlined too eagerly will bloat the instruction cache (cache rules everything around us). This is part of the reason that #[inline] and #[inline(always)] should be used carefully, and one reason why using a dynamic dispatch is sometimes more efficient. However, the common case is that it is more efficient to use static dispatch, and one can always have a thin statically-dispatched wrapper function that does a dynamic dispatch, but not vice versa, meaning static calls are more flexible. The standard library tries to be statically dispatched where possible for this reason."},"vectors.html#iterating":{"id":"vectors.html#iterating","title":"Iterating","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Iterating","body":"Once you have a vector, you can iterate through its elements with for .

Something like this: #[derive(HelloWorld)]\nstruct Pancakes; fn main() { Pancakes::hello_world();\n} With some kind of nice output, like Hello, World! My name is Pancakes. . Let's go ahead and write up what we think our macro will look like from a user perspective. In src/main.rs we write: #[macro_use]\nextern crate hello_world_derive; trait HelloWorld { fn hello_world();\n} #[derive(HelloWorld)]\nstruct FrenchToast; #[derive(HelloWorld)]\nstruct Waffles; fn main() { FrenchToast::hello_world(); Waffles::hello_world();\n} Great. So now we just need to actually write the procedural macro. At the moment, procedural macros need to be in their own crate. Eventually, this restriction may be lifted, but for now, it's required. As such, there's a convention; for a crate named foo , a custom derive procedural macro is called foo-derive . Let's start a new crate called hello-world-derive inside our hello-world project. $ cargo new hello-world-derive To make sure that our hello-world crate is able to find this new crate we've created, we'll add it to our toml: [dependencies]\nhello-world-derive = { path = \"hello-world-derive\" } As for the source of our hello-world-derive crate, here's an example: extern crate proc_macro;\nextern crate syn;\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate quote; use proc_macro::TokenStream; #[proc_macro_derive(HelloWorld)]\npub fn hello_world(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream { // Construct a string representation of the type definition let s = input.to_string(); // Parse the string representation let ast = syn::parse_derive_input(&s).unwrap(); // Build the impl let gen = impl_hello_world(&ast); // Return the generated impl gen.parse().unwrap()\n} So there is a lot going on here. We have introduced two new crates: syn and quote . As you may have noticed, input: TokenSteam is immediately converted to a String . This String is a string representation of the Rust code for which we are deriving HelloWorld . At the moment, the only thing you can do with a TokenStream is convert it to a string. A richer API will exist in the future. So what we really need is to be able to parse Rust code into something usable. This is where syn comes to play. syn is a crate for parsing Rust code. The other crate we've introduced is quote . It's essentially the dual of syn as it will make generating Rust code really easy. We could write this stuff on our own, but it's much simpler to use these libraries. Writing a full parser for Rust code is no simple task. The comments seem to give us a pretty good idea of our overall strategy. We are going to take a String of the Rust code for the type we are deriving, parse it using syn , construct the implementation of hello_world (using quote ), then pass it back to Rust compiler. One last note: you'll see some unwrap() s there. If you want to provide an error for a procedural macro, then you should panic! with the error message. In this case, we're keeping it as simple as possible. Great, so let's write impl_hello_world(&ast) . fn impl_hello_world(ast: &syn::DeriveInput) -> quote::Tokens { let name = &ast.ident; quote! { impl HelloWorld for #name { fn hello_world() { println!(\"Hello, World! My name is {}\", stringify!(#name)); } } }\n} So this is where quotes comes in. The ast argument is a struct that gives us a representation of our type (which can be either a struct or an enum ). Check out the docs , there is some useful information there. We are able to get the name of the type using ast.ident . The quote! macro lets us write up the Rust code that we wish to return and convert it into Tokens . quote! lets us use some really cool templating mechanics; we simply write #name and quote! will replace it with the variable named name . You can even do some repetition similar to regular macros work. You should check out the docs for a good introduction. So I think that's it. Oh, well, we do need to add dependencies for syn and quote in the Cargo.toml for hello-world-derive . [dependencies]\nsyn = \"0.11.11\"\nquote = \"0.3.15\" That should be it. Let's try to compile hello-world . error: the `#[proc_macro_derive]` attribute is only usable with crates of the `proc-macro` crate type --> hello-world-derive/src/lib.rs:8:3 |\n8 | #[proc_macro_derive(HelloWorld)] | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Oh, so it appears that we need to declare that our hello-world-derive crate is a proc-macro crate type.

This errors with: error: non-scalar cast: `[u8; 4]` as `u32`\nlet b = a as u32; // Four u8s makes a u32. ^~~~~~~~ This is a ‘non-scalar cast’ because we have multiple values here: the four elements of the array. These kinds of casts are very dangerous, because they make assumptions about the way that multiple underlying structures are implemented. For this, we need something more dangerous. The transmute function is very simple, but very scary. It tells Rust to treat a value of one type as though it were another type. It does this regardless of the typechecking system, and completely trusts you. In our previous example, we know that an array of four u8 s represents a u32 properly, and so we want to do the cast. Using transmute instead of as , Rust lets us: use std::mem; fn main() { unsafe { let a = [0u8, 1u8, 0u8, 0u8]; let b = mem::transmute::<[u8; 4], u32>(a); println!(\"{}\", b); // 256 // Or, more concisely: let c: u32 = mem::transmute(a); println!(\"{}\", c); // 256 }\n} We have to wrap the operation in an unsafe block for this to compile successfully.

Encoding the possibility of absence into the type system is an important concept because it will cause the compiler to force the programmer to handle that absence. Let's take a look at an example that tries to find a character in a string: // Searches `haystack` for the Unicode character `needle`. If one is found, the\n// byte offset of the character is returned. Otherwise, `None` is returned.\nfn find(haystack: &str, needle: char) -> Option<usize> { for (offset, c) in haystack.char_indices() { if c == needle { return Some(offset); } } None\n} Notice that when this function finds a matching character, it doesn't only return the offset . Instead, it returns Some(offset) . Some is a variant or a value constructor for the Option type. You can think of it as a function with the type fn<T>(value: T) -> Option<T> . Correspondingly, None is also a value constructor, except it has no arguments. You can think of None as a function with the type fn<T>() -> Option<T> . This might seem like much ado about nothing, but this is only half of the story. The other half is using the find function we've written. Let's try to use it to find the extension in a file name. # fn find(haystack: &str, needle: char) -> Option<usize> { haystack.find(needle) }\nfn main() { let file_name = \"foobar.rs\"; match find(file_name, '.') { None => println!(\"No file extension found.\"), Some(i) => println!(\"File extension: {}\", &file_name[i+1..]), }\n} This code uses pattern matching to do case analysis on the Option<usize> returned by the find function. In fact, case analysis is the only way to get at the value stored inside an Option<T> . This means that you, as the programmer, must handle the case when an Option<T> is None instead of Some(t) . But wait, what about unwrap , which we used previously ? There was no case analysis there! Instead, the case analysis was put inside the unwrap method for you. You could define it yourself if you want: enum Option<T> { None, Some(T),\n} impl<T> Option<T> { fn unwrap(self) -> T { match self { Option::Some(val) => val, Option::None => panic!(\"called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value\"), } }\n} The unwrap method abstracts away the case analysis .

This is a mutable variable binding . When a binding is mutable, it means you’re allowed to change what the binding points to. So in the above example, it’s not so much that the value at x is changing, but that the binding changed from one i32 to another. You can also create a reference to it, using &x , but if you want to use the reference to change it, you will need a mutable reference: let mut x = 5;\nlet y = &mut x; y is an immutable binding to a mutable reference, which means that you can’t bind 'y' to something else ( y = &mut z ), but y can be used to bind x to something else ( *y = 5 ). A subtle distinction. Of course, if you need both: let mut x = 5;\nlet mut y = &mut x; Now y can be bound to another value, and the value it’s referencing can be changed.

If you forget to say mut , the compiler will catch it, and let you know that you have mutated something you may not have intended to mutate. If bindings were mutable by default, the compiler would not be able to tell you this. If you did intend mutation, then the solution is quite easy: add mut . There are other good reasons to avoid mutable state when possible, but they’re out of the scope of this guide. In general, you can often avoid explicit mutation, and so it is preferable in Rust.

The key is to define a Result type alias that fixes one of the type parameters to a particular type. Usually the fixed type is the error type. For example, our previous example parsing integers could be rewritten like this: use std::num::ParseIntError;\nuse std::result; type Result<T> = result::Result<T, ParseIntError>; fn double_number(number_str: &str) -> Result<i32> { unimplemented!();\n} Why would we do this? Well, if we have a lot of functions that could return ParseIntError , then it's much more convenient to define an alias that always uses ParseIntError so that we don't have to write it out all the time. The most prominent place this idiom is used in the standard library is with io::Result .

When x goes out of scope at the end of main() , the code for Drop will run. Drop has one method, which is also called drop() . It takes a mutable reference to self . That’s it! The mechanics of Drop are very simple, but there are some subtleties. For example, values are dropped in the opposite order they are declared. Here’s another example: struct Firework { strength: i32,\n} impl Drop for Firework { fn drop(&mut self) { println!(\"BOOM times {}!!!\", self.strength); }\n} fn main() { let firecracker = Firework { strength: 1 }; let tnt = Firework { strength: 100 };\n} This will output: BOOM times 100!!!\nBOOM times 1!!! The tnt goes off before the firecracker does, because it was declared afterwards. Last in, first out. So what is Drop good for? Generally, Drop is used to clean up any resources associated with a struct . For example, the Arc<T> type is a reference-counted type.

When we write code like this: let x = 10; Rust allocates memory for an integer i32 on the stack , copies the bit pattern representing the value of 10 to the allocated memory and binds the variable name x to this memory region for future reference. Now consider the following code fragment: let v = vec![1, 2, 3]; let mut v2 = v; The first line allocates memory for the vector object v on the stack like it does for x above. But in addition to that it also allocates some memory on the heap for the actual data ( [1, 2, 3] ). Rust copies the address of this heap allocation to an internal pointer, which is part of the vector object placed on the stack (let's call it the data pointer). It is worth pointing out (even at the risk of stating the obvious) that the vector object and its data live in separate memory regions instead of being a single contiguous memory allocation (due to reasons we will not go into at this point of time). These two parts of the vector (the one on the stack and one on the heap) must agree with each other at all times with regards to things like the length, capacity, etc. When we move v to v2 , Rust actually does a bitwise copy of the vector object v into the stack allocation represented by v2 . This shallow copy does not create a copy of the heap allocation containing the actual data. Which means that there would be two pointers to the contents of the vector both pointing to the same memory allocation on the heap. It would violate Rust’s safety guarantees by introducing a data race if one could access both v and v2 at the same time. For example if we truncated the vector to just two elements through v2 : # let v = vec![1, 2, 3];\n# let mut v2 = v;\nv2.truncate(2); and v were still accessible we'd end up with an invalid vector since v would not know that the heap data has been truncated. Now, the part of the vector v on the stack does not agree with the corresponding part on the heap. v still thinks there are three elements in the vector and will happily let us access the non existent element v[2] but as you might already know this is a recipe for disaster. Especially because it might lead to a segmentation fault or worse allow an unauthorized user to read from memory to which they don't have access. This is why Rust forbids using v after we’ve done the move. It’s also important to note that optimizations may remove the actual copy of the bytes on the stack, depending on circumstances. So it may not be as inefficient as it initially seems."},"primitive-types.html#numeric-types":{"body":"Rust has a variety of numeric types in a few categories: signed and unsigned, fixed and variable, floating-point and integer.

Rc<T> is a reference counted pointer. In other words, this lets us have multiple \"owning\" pointers to the same data, and the data will be dropped (destructors will be run) when all pointers are out of scope. Internally, it contains a shared “reference count” (also called “refcount”), which is incremented each time the Rc is cloned, and decremented each time one of the Rc s goes out of scope. The main responsibility of Rc<T> is to ensure that destructors are called for shared data. The internal data here is immutable, and if a cycle of references is created, the data will be leaked. If we want data that doesn't leak when there are cycles, we need a garbage collector. Guarantees The main guarantee provided here is that the data will not be destroyed until all references to it are out of scope. This should be used when we wish to dynamically allocate and share some data (read-only) between various portions of your program, where it is not certain which portion will finish using the pointer last. It's a viable alternative to &T when &T is either impossible to statically check for correctness, or creates extremely unergonomic code where the programmer does not wish to spend the development cost of working with. This pointer is not thread-safe, and Rust will not let it be sent or shared with other threads. This lets one avoid the cost of atomics in situations where they are unnecessary. There is a sister smart pointer to this one, Weak<T> . This is a non-owning, but also non-borrowed, smart pointer. It is also similar to &T , but it is not restricted in lifetime—a Weak<T> can be held on to forever. However, it is possible that an attempt to access the inner data may fail and return None , since this can outlive the owned Rc s. This is useful for cyclic data structures and other things. Cost As far as memory goes, Rc<T> is a single allocation, though it will allocate two extra words (i.e. two usize values) as compared to a regular Box<T> (for \"strong\" and \"weak\" refcounts). Rc<T> has the computational cost of incrementing/decrementing the refcount whenever it is cloned or goes out of scope respectively.

So what’s the difference? let mut num = 5; { let mut add_num = |x: i32| num += x; add_num(5);\n} assert_eq!(10, num); So in this case, our closure took a mutable reference to num , and then when we called add_num , it mutated the underlying value, as we’d expect.

Things get more complicated when the external library spawns its own threads and invokes callbacks from there. In these cases access to Rust data structures inside the callbacks is especially unsafe and proper synchronization mechanisms must be used. Besides classical synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, one possibility in Rust is to use channels (in std::sync::mpsc ) to forward data from the C thread that invoked the callback into a Rust thread. If an asynchronous callback targets a special object in the Rust address space it is also absolutely necessary that no more callbacks are performed by the C library after the respective Rust object gets destroyed.

This also means that we can choose static vs dynamic dispatch as well. First, let’s write a function which takes something callable, calls it, and returns the result: fn call_with_one<F>(some_closure: F) -> i32 where F: Fn(i32) -> i32 { some_closure(1)\n} let answer = call_with_one(|x| x + 2); assert_eq!(3, answer); We pass our closure, |x| x + 2 , to call_with_one . It does what it suggests: it calls the closure, giving it 1 as an argument. Let’s examine the signature of call_with_one in more depth: fn call_with_one<F>(some_closure: F) -> i32\n# where F: Fn(i32) -> i32 {\n# some_closure(1) } We take one parameter, and it has the type F . We also return an i32 . This part isn’t interesting. The next part is: # fn call_with_one<F>(some_closure: F) -> i32 where F: Fn(i32) -> i32 {\n# some_closure(1) } Because Fn is a trait, we can use it as a bound for our generic type. In this case, our closure takes an i32 as an argument and returns an i32 , and so the generic bound we use is Fn(i32) -> i32 . There’s one other key point here: because we’re bounding a generic with a trait, this will get monomorphized, and therefore, we’ll be doing static dispatch into the closure. That’s pretty neat. In many languages, closures are inherently heap allocated, and will always involve dynamic dispatch. In Rust, we can stack allocate our closure environment, and statically dispatch the call. This happens quite often with iterators and their adapters, which often take closures as arguments. Of course, if we want dynamic dispatch, we can get that too. A trait object handles this case, as usual: fn call_with_one(some_closure: &Fn(i32) -> i32) -> i32 { some_closure(1)\n} let answer = call_with_one(&|x| x + 2); assert_eq!(3, answer); Now we take a trait object, a &Fn . And we have to make a reference to our closure when we pass it to call_with_one , so we use &|| . A quick note about closures that use explicit lifetimes. Sometimes you might have a closure that takes a reference like so: fn call_with_ref<F>(some_closure:F) -> i32 where F: Fn(&i32) -> i32 { let value = 0; some_closure(&value)\n} Normally you can specify the lifetime of the parameter to our closure. We could annotate it on the function declaration: fn call_with_ref<'a, F>(some_closure:F) -> i32 where F: Fn(&'a i32) -> i32 { However, this presents a problem in our case. When a function has an explicit lifetime parameter, that lifetime must be at least as long as the entire call to that function. The borrow checker will complain that value doesn't live long enough, because it is only in scope after its declaration inside the function body. What we need is a closure that can borrow its argument only for its own invocation scope, not for the outer function's scope. In order to say that, we can use Higher-Ranked Trait Bounds with the for<...> syntax: fn call_with_ref<F>(some_closure:F) -> i32 where F: for<'a> Fn(&'a i32) -> i32 { This lets the Rust compiler find the minimum lifetime to invoke our closure and satisfy the borrow checker's rules. Our function then compiles and executes as we expect. fn call_with_ref<F>(some_closure:F) -> i32 where F: for<'a> Fn(&'a i32) -> i32 { let value = 0; some_closure(&value)\n}"},"getting-started.html#troubleshooting":{"body":"If we've got Rust installed, we can open up a shell, and type this: $ rustc --version You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date.

Due to differences in operating systems, command shells, and bugs in installation, you may need to restart your shell, log out of the system, or configure PATH manually as appropriate for your operating environment. Rust does not do its own linking, and so you’ll need to have a linker installed. Doing so will depend on your specific system. For Linux-based systems, Rust will attempt to call cc for linking. On windows-msvc (Rust built on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio), this depends on having Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools installed. These do not need to be in %PATH% as rustc will find them automatically.

The #[link(...)] attribute is used to instruct the linker to link against the snappy library so the symbols are resolved. Foreign functions are assumed to be unsafe so calls to them need to be wrapped with unsafe {} as a promise to the compiler that everything contained within truly is safe. C libraries often expose interfaces that aren't thread-safe, and almost any function that takes a pointer argument isn't valid for all possible inputs since the pointer could be dangling, and raw pointers fall outside of Rust's safe memory model.

You can then define a tree of sub-modules under that root module. Modules allow you to partition your code within the crate itself. As an example, let’s make a phrases crate, which will give us various phrases in different languages.

There are two accepted forms of the link attribute today: #[link(name = \"foo\")] #[link(name = \"foo\", kind = \"bar\")] In both of these cases, foo is the name of the native library that we're linking to, and in the second case bar is the type of native library that the compiler is linking to. There are currently three known types of native libraries: Dynamic - #[link(name = \"readline\")] Static - #[link(name = \"my_build_dependency\", kind = \"static\")] Frameworks - #[link(name = \"CoreFoundation\", kind = \"framework\")] Note that frameworks are only available on macOS targets. The different kind values are meant to differentiate how the native library participates in linkage. From a linkage perspective, the Rust compiler creates two flavors of artifacts: partial (rlib/staticlib) and final (dylib/binary). Native dynamic library and framework dependencies are propagated to the final artifact boundary, while static library dependencies are not propagated at all, because the static libraries are integrated directly into the subsequent artifact. A few examples of how this model can be used are: A native build dependency. Sometimes some C/C++ glue is needed when writing some Rust code, but distribution of the C/C++ code in a library format is a burden. In this case, the code will be archived into libfoo.a and then the Rust crate would declare a dependency via #[link(name = \"foo\", kind = \"static\")] . Regardless of the flavor of output for the crate, the native static library will be included in the output, meaning that distribution of the native static library is not necessary. A normal dynamic dependency. Common system libraries (like readline ) are available on a large number of systems, and often a static copy of these libraries cannot be found. When this dependency is included in a Rust crate, partial targets (like rlibs) will not link to the library, but when the rlib is included in a final target (like a binary), the native library will be linked in.

From is very useful because it gives us a generic way to talk about conversion from a particular type T to some other type (in this case, “some other type” is the subject of the impl, or Self ). The crux of From is the set of implementations provided by the standard library . Here are a few simple examples demonstrating how From works: let string: String = From::from(\"foo\");\nlet bytes: Vec<u8> = From::from(\"foo\");\nlet cow: ::std::borrow::Cow<str> = From::from(\"foo\"); OK, so From is useful for converting between strings. But what about errors? It turns out, there is one critical impl: impl<'a, E: Error + 'a> From<E> for Box<Error + 'a> This impl says that for any type that impls Error , we can convert it to a trait object Box<Error> . This may not seem terribly surprising, but it is useful in a generic context. Remember the two errors we were dealing with previously? Specifically, io::Error and num::ParseIntError . Since both impl Error , they work with From : use std::error::Error;\nuse std::fs;\nuse std::io;\nuse std::num; // We have to jump through some hoops to actually get error values:\nlet io_err: io::Error = io::Error::last_os_error();\nlet parse_err: num::ParseIntError = \"not a number\".parse::<i32>().unwrap_err(); // OK, here are the conversions:\nlet err1: Box<Error> = From::from(io_err);\nlet err2: Box<Error> = From::from(parse_err); There is a really important pattern to recognize here. Both err1 and err2 have the same type . This is because they are existentially quantified types, or trait objects. In particular, their underlying type is erased from the compiler's knowledge, so it truly sees err1 and err2 as exactly the same. Additionally, we constructed err1 and err2 using precisely the same function call: From::from . This is because From::from is overloaded on both its argument and its return type. This pattern is important because it solves a problem we had earlier: it gives us a way to reliably convert errors to the same type using the same function.

Trait objects, like &Foo or Box<Foo> , are normal values that store a value of any type that implements the given trait, where the precise type can only be known at runtime. A trait object can be obtained from a pointer to a concrete type that implements the trait by casting it (e.g. &x as &Foo ) or coercing it (e.g. using &x as an argument to a function that takes &Foo ). These trait object coercions and casts also work for pointers like &mut T to &mut Foo and Box<T> to Box<Foo> , but that’s all at the moment. Coercions and casts are identical. This operation can be seen as ‘erasing’ the compiler’s knowledge about the specific type of the pointer, and hence trait objects are sometimes referred to as ‘type erasure’. Coming back to the example above, we can use the same trait to perform dynamic dispatch with trait objects by casting: # trait Foo { fn method(&self) -> String; }\n# impl Foo for u8 { fn method(&self) -> String { format!(\"u8: {}\", *self) } }\n# impl Foo for String { fn method(&self) -> String { format!(\"string: {}\", *self) } }\nfn do_something(x: &Foo) { x.method();\n} fn main() { let x = 5u8; do_something(&x as &Foo);\n} or by coercing: # trait Foo { fn method(&self) -> String; }\n# impl Foo for u8 { fn method(&self) -> String { format!(\"u8: {}\", *self) } }\n# impl Foo for String { fn method(&self) -> String { format!(\"string: {}\", *self) } }\nfn do_something(x: &Foo) { x.method();\n} fn main() { let x = \"Hello\".to_string(); do_something(&x);\n} A function that takes a trait object is not specialized to each of the types that implements Foo : only one copy is generated, often (but not always) resulting in less code bloat.

But in the Err arm, we use _ to disregard the specific error, and print a general error message. _ is valid in any pattern that creates a binding.

It’s worth noting that using _ never binds the value in the first place, which means that the value does not move: let tuple: (u32, String) = (5, String::from(\"five\")); // Here, tuple is moved, because the String moved:\nlet (x, _s) = tuple; // The next line would give \"error: use of partially moved value: `tuple`\".\n// println!(\"Tuple is: {:?}\", tuple); // However, let tuple = (5, String::from(\"five\")); // Here, tuple is _not_ moved, as the String was never moved, and u32 is Copy:\nlet (x, _) = tuple; // That means this works:\nprintln!(\"Tuple is: {:?}\", tuple); This also means that any temporary variables will be dropped at the end of the statement: // Here, the String created will be dropped immediately, as it’s not bound: let _ = String::from(\" hello \").trim(); You can also use .. in a pattern to disregard multiple values: enum OptionalTuple { Value(i32, i32, i32), Missing,\n} let x = OptionalTuple::Value(5, -2, 3); match x { OptionalTuple::Value(..) => println!(\"Got a tuple!\"), OptionalTuple::Missing => println!(\"No such luck.\"),\n} This prints Got a tuple! .","title":"Ignoring bindings","id":"patterns.html#ignoring-bindings","breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Ignoring bindings"},"using-rust-without-the-standard-library.html#using-rust-without-the-standard-library":{"body":"Rust’s standard library provides a lot of useful functionality, but assumes support for various features of its host system: threads, networking, heap allocation, and others.

Rust does not yet include random number functionality in its standard library. The Rust team does, however, provide a rand crate . A ‘crate’ is a package of Rust code. We’ve been building a ‘binary crate’, which is an executable. rand is a ‘library crate’, which contains code that’s intended to be used with other programs. Using external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we can write the code using rand , we need to modify our Cargo.toml . Open it up, and add these few lines at the bottom: [dependencies] rand = \"0.3.0\" The [dependencies] section of Cargo.toml is like the [package] section: everything that follows it is part of it, until the next section starts. Cargo uses the dependencies section to know what dependencies on external crates you have, and what versions you require. In this case, we’ve specified version 0.3.0 , which Cargo understands to be any release that’s compatible with this specific version. Cargo understands Semantic Versioning , which is a standard for writing version numbers. A bare number like above is actually shorthand for ^0.3.0 , meaning \"anything compatible with 0.3.0\". If we wanted to use only 0.3.0 exactly, we could say rand = \"=0.3.0\" (note the two equal signs). We could also use a range of versions. Cargo’s documentation contains more details. Now, without changing any of our code, let’s build our project: $ cargo build Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index` Downloading rand v0.3.14 Downloading libc v0.2.17 Compiling libc v0.2.17 Compiling rand v0.3.14 Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game) Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 5.88 secs (You may see different versions, of course.) Lots of new output! Now that we have an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything from the registry, which is a copy of data from Crates.io . Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use. After updating the registry, Cargo checks our [dependencies] and downloads any we don’t have yet. In this case, while we only said we wanted to depend on rand , we’ve also grabbed a copy of libc . This is because rand depends on libc to work. After downloading them, it compiles them, and then compiles our project. If we run cargo build again, we’ll get different output: $ cargo build Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs That’s right, nothing was done! Cargo knows that our project has been built, and that all of its dependencies are built, and so there’s no reason to do all that stuff. With nothing to do, it simply exits. If we open up src/main.rs again, make a trivial change, and then save it again, we’ll only see two lines: $ cargo build Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game) Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.45 secs So, we told Cargo we wanted any 0.3.x version of rand , and so it fetched the latest version at the time this was written, v0.3.14 . But what happens when next week, version v0.3.15 comes out, with an important bugfix? While getting bugfixes is important, what if 0.3.15 contains a regression that breaks our code? The answer to this problem is the Cargo.lock file you’ll now find in your project directory. When you build your project for the first time, Cargo figures out all of the versions that fit your criteria, and then writes them to the Cargo.lock file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see that the Cargo.lock file exists, and then use that specific version rather than do all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you have a repeatable build automatically. In other words, we’ll stay at 0.3.14 until we explicitly upgrade, and so will anyone who we share our code with, thanks to the lock file. What about when we do want to use v0.3.15 ? Cargo has another command, update , which says ‘ignore the lock, figure out all the latest versions that fit what we’ve specified. If that works, write those versions out to the lock file’. But, by default, Cargo will only look for versions larger than 0.3.0 and smaller than 0.4.0 . If we want to move to 0.4.x , we’d have to update the Cargo.toml directly. When we do, the next time we cargo build , Cargo will update the index and re-evaluate our rand requirements. There’s a lot more to say about Cargo and its ecosystem , but for now, that’s all we need to know. Cargo makes it really easy to re-use libraries, and so Rustaceans tend to write smaller projects which are assembled out of a number of sub-packages. Let’s get on to actually using rand . Here’s our next step: extern crate rand; use std::io;\nuse rand::Rng; fn main() { println!(\"Guess the number!\"); let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); println!(\"The secret number is: {}\", secret_number); println!(\"Please input your guess.\"); let mut guess = String::new(); io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess) .expect(\"Failed to read line\"); println!(\"You guessed: {}\", guess);\n} The first thing we’ve done is change the first line. It now says extern crate rand . Because we declared rand in our [dependencies] , we can use extern crate to let Rust know we’ll be making use of it. This also does the equivalent of a use rand; as well, so we can make use of anything in the rand crate by prefixing it with rand:: . Next, we added another use line: use rand::Rng . We’re going to use a method in a moment, and it requires that Rng be in scope to work. The basic idea is this: methods are defined on something called ‘traits’, and for the method to work, it needs the trait to be in scope. For more about the details, read the traits section. There are two other lines we added, in the middle: let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101); println!(\"The secret number is: {}\", secret_number); We use the rand::thread_rng() function to get a copy of the random number generator, which is local to the particular thread of execution we’re in. Because we use rand::Rng ’d above, it has a gen_range() method available. This method takes two arguments, and generates a number between them. It’s inclusive on the lower bound, but exclusive on the upper bound, so we need 1 and 101 to get a number ranging from one to a hundred. The second line prints out the secret number. This is useful while we’re developing our program, so we can easily test it out. But we’ll be deleting it for the final version. It’s not much of a game if it prints out the answer when you start it up! Try running our new program a few times: $ cargo run Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///home/you/projects/guessing_game) Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.55 secs Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 7\nPlease input your guess.\n4\nYou guessed: 4\n$ cargo run Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 83\nPlease input your guess.\n5\nYou guessed: 5 Great!

So let’s talk about it, to make sure you grasp the nuances. if is a specific form of a more general concept, the ‘branch’, whose name comes from a branch in a tree: a decision point, where depending on a choice, multiple paths can be taken. In the case of if , there is one choice that leads down two paths: let x = 5; if x == 5 { println!(\"x is five!\");\n} If we changed the value of x to something else, this line would not print. More specifically, if the expression after the if evaluates to true , then the block is executed. If it’s false , then it is not. If you want something to happen in the false case, use an else : let x = 5; if x == 5 { println!(\"x is five!\");\n} else { println!(\"x is not five :(\");\n} If there is more than one case, use an else if : let x = 5; if x == 5 { println!(\"x is five!\");\n} else if x == 6 { println!(\"x is six!\");\n} else { println!(\"x is not five or six :(\");\n} This is all pretty standard. However, you can also do this: let x = 5; let y = if x == 5 { 10\n} else { 15\n}; // y: i32 Which we can (and probably should) write like this: let x = 5; let y = if x == 5 { 10 } else { 15 }; // y: i32 This works because if is an expression. The value of the expression is the value of the last expression in whichever branch was chosen. An if without an else always results in () as the value."},"trait-objects.html#object-safety":{"breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Object Safety","body":"Not every trait can be used to make a trait object.

For sharing references across threads, Rust provides a wrapper type called Arc<T> . Arc<T> implements Send and Sync if and only if T implements both Send and Sync . For example, an object of type Arc<RefCell<U>> cannot be transferred across threads because RefCell does not implement Sync , consequently Arc<RefCell<U>> would not implement Send .

The module allows us to group all of our tests together, and to also define helper functions if needed, that don't become a part of the rest of our crate. The cfg attribute only compiles our test code if we're currently trying to run the tests. This can save compile time, and also ensures that our tests are entirely left out of a normal build. The second change is the use declaration. Because we're in an inner module, we need to bring the tested function into scope.

Sometimes, you need to pass some memory between different functions, or keep it alive for longer than a single function’s execution. For this, we can use the heap. In Rust, you can allocate memory on the heap with the Box<T> type . Here’s an example: fn main() { let x = Box::new(5); let y = 42;\n} Here’s what happens in memory when main() is called: Address Name Value 1 y 42 0 x ?????? We allocate space for two variables on the stack. y is 42 , as it always has been, but what about x ? Well, x is a Box<i32> , and boxes allocate memory on the heap. The actual value of the box is a structure which has a pointer to ‘the heap’. When we start executing the function, and Box::new() is called, it allocates some memory for the heap, and puts 5 there. The memory now looks like this: Address Name Value (230) - 1 5 ... ... ... 1 y 42 0 x → (230) - 1 We have (230) addresses in our hypothetical computer with 1GiB of RAM. And since our stack grows from zero, the easiest place to allocate memory is from the other end. So our first value is at the highest place in memory. And the value of the struct at x has a raw pointer to the place we’ve allocated on the heap, so the value of x is (230) - 1, the memory location we’ve asked for. We haven’t really talked too much about what it actually means to allocate and deallocate memory in these contexts. Getting into very deep detail is out of the scope of this tutorial, but what’s important to point out here is that the heap isn’t a stack that grows from the opposite end. We’ll have an example of this later in the book, but because the heap can be allocated and freed in any order, it can end up with ‘holes’. Here’s a diagram of the memory layout of a program which has been running for a while now: Address Name Value (230) - 1 5 (230) - 2 (230) - 3 (230) - 4 42 ... ... ... 2 z → (230) - 4 1 y 42 0 x → (230) - 1 In this case, we’ve allocated four things on the heap, but deallocated two of them. There’s a gap between (230) - 1 and (230) - 4 which isn’t currently being used. The specific details of how and why this happens depends on what kind of strategy you use to manage the heap. Different programs can use different ‘memory allocators’, which are libraries that manage this for you. Rust programs use jemalloc for this purpose. Anyway, back to our example. Since this memory is on the heap, it can stay alive longer than the function which allocates the box. In this case, however, it doesn’t. [2] When the function is over, we need to free the stack frame for main() . Box<T> , though, has a trick up its sleeve: Drop . The implementation of Drop for Box deallocates the memory that was allocated when it was created. Great! So when x goes away, it first frees the memory allocated on the heap: Address Name Value 1 y 42 0 x ?????? We can make the memory live longer by transferring ownership, sometimes called ‘moving out of the box’. More complex examples will be covered later. And then the stack frame goes away, freeing all of our memory.","breadcrumbs":"Effective Rust » The Heap"},"references-and-borrowing.html#use-after-free":{"breadcrumbs":"Syntax and Semantics » Use after free","id":"references-and-borrowing.html#use-after-free","body":"References must not live longer than the resource they refer to. Rust will check the scopes of your references to ensure that this is true. If Rust didn’t check this property, we could accidentally use a reference which was invalid. For example: let y: &i32;\n{ let x = 5; y = &x;\n} println!(\"{}\", y); We get this error: error: `x` does not live long enough y = &x; ^\nnote: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement 0 at\n2:16...\nlet y: &i32;\n{ let x = 5; y = &x;\n} note: ...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix following\nstatement 0 at 4:18 let x = 5; y = &x;\n} In other words, y is only valid for the scope where x exists. As soon as x goes away, it becomes invalid to refer to it. As such, the error says that the borrow ‘doesn’t live long enough’ because it’s not valid for the right amount of time. The same problem occurs when the reference is declared before the variable it refers to. This is because resources within the same scope are freed in the opposite order they were declared: let y: &i32;\nlet x = 5;\ny = &x; println!(\"{}\", y); We get this error: error: `x` does not live long enough\ny = &x; ^\nnote: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement 0 at\n2:16... let y: &i32; let x = 5; y = &x; println!(\"{}\", y);\n} note: ...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix following\nstatement 1 at 3:14 let x = 5; y = &x; println!(\"{}\", y);\n} In the above example, y is declared before x , meaning that y lives longer than x , which is not allowed.","title":"Use after free"},"error-handling.html#writing-the-logic":{"body":"We all write code differently, but error handling is usually the last thing we want to think about. This isn't great for the overall design of a program, but it can be useful for rapid prototyping. Because Rust forces us to be explicit about error handling (by making us call unwrap ), it is easy to see which parts of our program can cause errors. In this case study, the logic is really simple. All we need to do is parse the CSV data given to us and print out a field in matching rows. Let's do it. (Make sure to add extern crate csv; to the top of your file.) use std::fs::File; // This struct represents the data in each row of the CSV file.\n// Type based decoding absolves us of a lot of the nitty-gritty error\n// handling, like parsing strings as integers or floats.\n#[derive(Debug, RustcDecodable)]\nstruct Row { country: String, city: String, accent_city: String, region: String, // Not every row has data for the population, latitude or longitude! // So we express them as `Option` types, which admits the possibility of // absence. The CSV parser will fill in the correct value for us. population: Option<u64>, latitude: Option<f64>, longitude: Option<f64>,\n} fn print_usage(program: &str, opts: Options) { println!(\"{}\", opts.usage(&format!(\"Usage: {} [options] <data-path> <city>\", program)));\n} fn main() { let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect(); let program = &args[0]; let mut opts = Options::new(); opts.optflag(\"h\", \"help\", \"Show this usage message.\"); let matches = match opts.parse(&args[1..]) { Ok(m) => { m } Err(e) => { panic!(e.to_string()) } }; if matches.opt_present(\"h\") { print_usage(&program, opts); return; } let data_path = &matches.free[0]; let city: &str = &matches.free[1]; let file = File::open(data_path).unwrap(); let mut rdr = csv::Reader::from_reader(file); for row in rdr.decode::<Row>() { let row = row.unwrap(); if row.city == city { println!(\"{}, {}: {:?}\", row.city, row.country, row.population.expect(\"population count\")); } }\n} Let's outline the errors. We can start with the obvious: the three places that unwrap is called: File::open can return an io::Error . csv::Reader::decode decodes one record at a time, and decoding a record (look at the Item associated type on the Iterator impl) can produce a csv::Error . If row.population is None , then calling expect will panic. Are there any others? What if we can't find a matching city? Tools like grep will return an error code, so we probably should too. So we have logic errors specific to our problem, IO errors and CSV parsing errors. We're going to explore two different ways to approach handling these errors. I'd like to start with Box<Error> .

However, we can do a bit better. To solve this, some C libraries will instead create a struct , where the details and memory layout of the struct are private. This gives some amount of type safety. These structures are called ‘opaque’. Here’s an example, in C: struct Foo; /* Foo is a structure, but its contents are not part of the public interface */\nstruct Bar;\nvoid foo(struct Foo *arg);\nvoid bar(struct Bar *arg); To do this in Rust, let’s create our own opaque types: #[repr(C)] pub struct Foo { private: [u8; 0] }\n#[repr(C)] pub struct Bar { private: [u8; 0] } extern \"C\" { pub fn foo(arg: *mut Foo); pub fn bar(arg: *mut Bar);\n}\n# fn main() {} By including a private field and no constructor, we create an opaque type that we can’t instantiate outside of this module.
