Reference » Working with an unpublished minor version","title":"Working with an unpublished minor version","body":"Let's now shift gears a bit from bug fixes to adding features. While working on my-library you discover that a whole new feature is needed in the uuid crate. You've implemented this feature, tested it locally above with [patch] , and submitted a pull request. Let's go over how you continue to use and test it before it's actually published. Let's also say that the current version of uuid on crates.io is 1.0.0 , but since then the master branch of the git repository has updated to 1.0.1 . This branch includes your new feature you submitted previously. To use this repository we'll edit our Cargo.toml to look like [package]\nname = \"my-library\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"...\"] [dependencies]\nuuid = \"1.0.1\" [patch.crates-io]\nuuid = { git = 'https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid' } Note that our local dependency on uuid has been updated to 1.0.1 as it's what we'll actually require once the crate is published. This version doesn't exist on crates.io, though, so we provide it with the [patch] section of the manifest. Now when our library is built it'll fetch uuid from the git repository and resolve to 1.0.1 inside the repository instead of trying to download a version from crates.io. Once 1.0.1 is published on crates.io the [patch] section can be deleted. It's also worth noting that [patch] applies transitively . Let's say you use my-library in a larger project, such as: [package]\nname = \"my-binary\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"...\"] [dependencies]\nmy-library = { git = 'https://example.com/git/my-library' }\nuuid = \"1.0\" [patch.crates-io]\nuuid = { git = 'https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid' } Remember that [patch] is applicable transitively but can only be defined at the top level so we consumers of my-library have to repeat the [patch] section if necessary. Here, though, the new uuid crate applies to both our dependency on uuid and the my-library -> uuid dependency. The uuid crate will be resolved to one version for this entire crate graph, 1.0.1, and it'll be pulled from the git repository. Overriding repository URL In case the dependency you want to override isn't loaded from crates.io , you'll have to change a bit how you use [patch] : [patch.\"https://github.com/your/repository\"]\nmy-library = { path = \"../my-library/path\" } And that's it!","id":"reference/specifying-dependencies.html#working-with-an-unpublished-minor-version"},"reference/build-scripts.html#case-study-building-some-native-code":{"body":"Sometimes it’s necessary to build some native C or C++ code as part of a package. This is another excellent use case of leveraging the build script to build a native library before the Rust crate itself. As an example, we’ll create a Rust library which calls into C to print “Hello, World!”. Like above, let’s first take a look at the project layout: .\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── build.rs\n└── src ├── hello.c └── main.rs 1 directory, 4 files Pretty similar to before! Next, the manifest: # Cargo.toml [package]\nname = \"hello-world-from-c\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"you@example.com\"]\nbuild = \"build.rs\" For now we’re not going to use any build dependencies, so let’s take a look at the build script now: // build.rs use std::process::Command;\nuse std::env;\nuse std::path::Path; fn main() { let out_dir = env::var(\"OUT_DIR\").unwrap(); // note that there are a number of downsides to this approach, the comments // below detail how to improve the portability of these commands. Command::new(\"gcc\").args(&[\"src/hello.c\", \"-c\", \"-fPIC\", \"-o\"]) .arg(&format!(\"{}/hello.o\", out_dir)) .status().unwrap(); Command::new(\"ar\").args(&[\"crus\", \"libhello.a\", \"hello.o\"]) .current_dir(&Path::new(&out_dir)) .status().unwrap(); println!(\"cargo:rustc-link-search=native={}\", out_dir); println!(\"cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=hello\");\n} This build script starts out by compiling our C file into an object file (by invoking gcc ) and then converting this object file into a static library (by invoking ar ). The final step is feedback to Cargo itself to say that our output was in out_dir and the compiler should link the crate to libhello.a statically via the -l static=hello flag. Note that there are a number of drawbacks to this hardcoded approach: The gcc command itself is not portable across platforms. For example it’s unlikely that Windows platforms have gcc , and not even all Unix platforms may have gcc . The ar command is also in a similar situation. These commands do not take cross-compilation into account. If we’re cross compiling for a platform such as Android it’s unlikely that gcc will produce an ARM executable. Not to fear, though, this is where a build-dependencies entry would help! The Cargo ecosystem has a number of packages to make this sort of task much easier, portable, and standardized. For example, the build script could be written as: // build.rs // Bring in a dependency on an externally maintained `cc` package which manages\n// invoking the C compiler.\nextern crate cc; fn main() { cc::Build::new() .file(\"src/hello.c\") .compile(\"hello\");\n} Add a build time dependency on the cc crate with the following addition to your Cargo.toml : [build-dependencies]\ncc = \"1.0\" The cc crate abstracts a range of build script requirements for C code: It invokes the appropriate compiler (MSVC for windows, gcc for MinGW, cc for Unix platforms, etc.). It takes the TARGET variable into account by passing appropriate flags to the compiler being used. Other environment variables, such as OPT_LEVEL , DEBUG , etc., are all handled automatically. The stdout output and OUT_DIR locations are also handled by the cc library. Here we can start to see some of the major benefits of farming as much functionality as possible out to common build dependencies rather than duplicating logic across all build scripts! Back to the case study though, let’s take a quick look at the contents of the src directory: // src/hello.c #include <stdio.h> void hello() { printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");\n} // src/main.rs // Note the lack of the `#[link]` attribute. We’re delegating the responsibility\n// of selecting what to link to over to the build script rather than hardcoding\n// it in the source file.\nextern { fn hello(); } fn main() { unsafe { hello(); }\n} And there we go!

We’re not going to look at specific snippets of code here and instead only take a look at the high-level details of the build script of libgit2-sys . This is not recommending all packages follow this strategy, but rather just outlining one specific strategy. The first step of the build script should do is to query whether libgit2 is already installed on the host system. To do this we’ll leverage the preexisting tool pkg-config (when its available). We’ll also use a build-dependencies section to refactor out all the pkg-config related code (or someone’s already done that!). If pkg-config failed to find libgit2, or if pkg-config just wasn’t installed, the next step is to build libgit2 from bundled source code (distributed as part of libgit2-sys itself). There are a few nuances when doing so that we need to take into account, however: The build system of libgit2, cmake , needs to be able to find libgit2’s optional dependency of libssh2. We’re sure we’ve already built it (it’s a Cargo dependency), we just need to communicate this information. To do this we leverage the metadata format to communicate information between build scripts. In this example the libssh2 package printed out cargo:root=... to tell us where libssh2 is installed at, and we can then pass this along to cmake with the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable. We’ll need to handle some CFLAGS values when compiling C code (and tell cmake about this). Some flags we may want to pass are -m64 for 64-bit code, -m32 for 32-bit code, or -fPIC for 64-bit code as well. Finally, we’ll invoke cmake to place all output into the OUT_DIR environment variable, and then we’ll print the necessary metadata to instruct rustc how to link to libgit2. Most of the functionality of this build script is easily refactorable into common dependencies, so our build script isn’t quite as intimidating as this descriptions!

Here we’ll walk through a simple example which generates a library call as part of the build script. First, let’s take a look at the directory structure of this package: .\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── build.rs\n└── src └── main.rs 1 directory, 3 files Here we can see that we have a build.rs build script and our binary in main.rs . Next, let’s take a look at the manifest: # Cargo.toml [package]\nname = \"hello-from-generated-code\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"you@example.com\"]\nbuild = \"build.rs\" Here we can see we’ve got a build script specified which we’ll use to generate some code. Let’s see what’s inside the build script: // build.rs use std::env;\nuse std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::Write;\nuse std::path::Path; fn main() { let out_dir = env::var(\"OUT_DIR\").unwrap(); let dest_path = Path::new(&out_dir).join(\"hello.rs\"); let mut f = File::create(&dest_path).unwrap(); f.write_all(b\" pub fn message() -> &'static str { \\\"Hello, World!\\\" } \").unwrap();\n} There’s a couple of points of note here: The script uses the OUT_DIR environment variable to discover where the output files should be located. It can use the process’ current working directory to find where the input files should be located, but in this case we don’t have any input files. In general, build scripts should not modify any files outside of OUT_DIR . It may seem fine on the first blush, but it does cause problems when you use such crate as a dependency, because there's an implicit invariant that sources in .cargo/registry should be immutable. cargo won't allow such scripts when packaging. This script is relatively simple as it just writes out a small generated file. One could imagine that other more fanciful operations could take place such as generating a Rust module from a C header file or another language definition, for example. Next, let’s peek at the library itself: // src/main.rs include!(concat!(env!(\"OUT_DIR\"), \"/hello.rs\")); fn main() { println!(\"{}\", message());\n} This is where the real magic happens. The library is using the rustc-defined include! macro in combination with the concat! and env! macros to include the generated file ( hello.rs ) into the crate’s compilation.

The version field Cargo bakes in the concept of Semantic Versioning , so make sure you follow some basic rules: Before you reach 1.0.0, anything goes, but if you make breaking changes, increment the minor version. In Rust, breaking changes include adding fields to structs or variants to enums. After 1.0.0, only make breaking changes when you increment the major version. Don’t break the build. After 1.0.0, don’t add any new public API (no new pub anything) in tiny versions. Always increment the minor version if you add any new pub structs, traits, fields, types, functions, methods or anything else. Use version numbers with three numeric parts such as 1.0.0 rather than 1.0. The build field (optional) This field specifies a file in the project root which is a build script for building native code. More information can be found in the build script guide .

More information can be found in the links section of the build script guide. [package]\n# ...\nlinks = \"foo\"\nbuild = \"build.rs\" The documentation field (optional) This field specifies a URL to a website hosting the crate's documentation. If no URL is specified in the manifest file, crates.io will automatically link your crate to the corresponding docs.rs page. Documentation links from specific hosts are blacklisted. Hosts are added to the blacklist if they are known to not be hosting documentation and are possibly of malicious intent e.g. ad tracking networks. URLs from the following hosts are blacklisted: rust-ci.org Documentation URLs from blacklisted hosts will not appear on crates.io, and may be replaced by docs.rs links. The exclude and include fields (optional) You can explicitly specify to Cargo that a set of globs should be ignored or included for the purposes of packaging and rebuilding a package. The globs specified in the exclude field identify a set of files that are not included when a package is published as well as ignored for the purposes of detecting when to rebuild a package, and the globs in include specify files that are explicitly included. If a VCS is being used for a package, the exclude field will be seeded with the VCS’ ignore settings ( .gitignore for git for example). [package]\n# ...\nexclude = [\"build/**/*.o\", \"doc/**/*.html\"] [package]\n# ...\ninclude = [\"src/**/*\", \"Cargo.toml\"] The options are mutually exclusive: setting include will override an exclude . Note that include must be an exhaustive list of files as otherwise necessary source files may not be included. Migrating to gitignore -like pattern matching The current interpretation of these configs is based on UNIX Globs, as implemented in the glob crate . We want Cargo's include and exclude configs to work as similar to gitignore as possible. The gitignore specification is also based on Globs, but has a bunch of additional features that enable easier pattern writing and more control. Therefore, we are migrating the interpretation for the rules of these configs to use the ignore crate , and treat them each rule as a single line in a gitignore file.

Sticking with our previous crates, this means that we're going to be creating version 2.0.0 of the uuid crate.

Like with the previous example the 2.0.0 version doesn't actually exist on crates.io but we can still put it in through a git dependency through the usage of the [patch] section.

If you would like to see such output directly in your terminal, invoke cargo as 'very verbose' with the -vv flag. Note that if neither the build script nor project source files are modified, subsequent calls to cargo with -vv will not print output to the terminal because a new build is not executed. Run cargo clean before each cargo invocation if you want to ensure that output is always displayed on your terminal. Any line that starts with cargo: is interpreted directly by Cargo. This line must be of the form cargo:key=value , like the examples below: # specially recognized by Cargo\ncargo:rustc-link-lib=static=foo\ncargo:rustc-link-search=native=/path/to/foo\ncargo:rustc-cfg=foo\ncargo:rustc-env=FOO=bar\n# arbitrary user-defined metadata\ncargo:root=/path/to/foo\ncargo:libdir=/path/to/foo/lib\ncargo:include=/path/to/foo/include On the other hand, lines printed to stderr are written to a file like target/debug/build/<pkg>/stderr but are not interpreted by cargo. There are a few special keys that Cargo recognizes, some affecting how the crate is built: rustc-link-lib=[KIND=]NAME indicates that the specified value is a library name and should be passed to the compiler as a -l flag. The optional KIND can be one of static , dylib (the default), or framework , see rustc --help for more details. rustc-link-search=[KIND=]PATH indicates the specified value is a library search path and should be passed to the compiler as a -L flag. The optional KIND can be one of dependency , crate , native , framework or all (the default), see rustc --help for more details. rustc-flags=FLAGS is a set of flags passed to the compiler, only -l and -L flags are supported. rustc-cfg=FEATURE indicates that the specified feature will be passed as a --cfg flag to the compiler. This is often useful for performing compile-time detection of various features. rustc-env=VAR=VALUE indicates that the specified environment variable will be added to the environment which the compiler is run within. The value can be then retrieved by the env! macro in the compiled crate. This is useful for embedding additional metadata in crate's code, such as the hash of Git HEAD or the unique identifier of a continuous integration server. rerun-if-changed=PATH is a path to a file or directory which indicates that the build script should be re-run if it changes (detected by a more-recent last-modified timestamp on the file). Normally build scripts are re-run if any file inside the crate root changes, but this can be used to scope changes to just a small set of files. (If this path points to a directory the entire directory will not be traversed for changes -- only changes to the timestamp of the directory itself (which corresponds to some types of changes within the directory, depending on platform) will trigger a rebuild. To request a re-run on any changes within an entire directory, print a line for the directory and another line for everything inside it, recursively.) Note that if the build script itself (or one of its dependencies) changes, then it's rebuilt and rerun unconditionally, so cargo:rerun-if-changed=build.rs is almost always redundant (unless you want to ignore changes in all other files except for build.rs ). rerun-if-env-changed=VAR is the name of an environment variable which indicates that if the environment variable's value changes the build script should be rerun. This basically behaves the same as rerun-if-changed except that it works with environment variables instead. Note that the environment variables here are intended for global environment variables like CC and such, it's not necessary to use this for env vars like TARGET that Cargo sets. Also note that if rerun-if-env-changed is printed out then Cargo will only rerun the build script if those environment variables change or if files printed out by rerun-if-changed change. warning=MESSAGE is a message that will be printed to the main console after a build script has finished running. Warnings are only shown for path dependencies (that is, those you're working on locally), so for example warnings printed out in crates.io crates are not emitted by default. Any other element is a user-defined metadata that will be passed to dependents.

That said, we think that crates.io offers a number of important benefits, and will likely become the primary way that people download packages in Cargo. For precedent, both Node.js’s npm and Ruby’s bundler support both a central registry model as well as a Git-based model, and most packages are downloaded through the registry in those ecosystems, with an important minority of packages making use of git-based packages. Some of the advantages that make a central registry popular in other languages include: Discoverability . A central registry provides an easy place to look for existing packages. Combined with tagging, this also makes it possible for a registry to provide ecosystem-wide information, such as a list of the most popular or most-depended-on packages. Speed . A central registry makes it possible to easily fetch just the metadata for packages quickly and efficiently, and then to efficiently download just the published package, and not other bloat that happens to exist in the repository. This adds up to a significant improvement in the speed of dependency resolution and fetching. As dependency graphs scale up, downloading all of the git repositories bogs down fast. Also remember that not everybody has a high-speed, low-latency Internet connection.","breadcrumbs":"Why build crates.io rather than use GitHub as a registry?"},"faq.html#how-can-cargo-work-offline":{"body":"Cargo is often used in situations with limited or no network access such as airplanes, CI environments, or embedded in large production deployments. Users are often surprised when Cargo attempts to fetch resources from the network, and hence the request for Cargo to work offline comes up frequently. Cargo, at its heart, will not attempt to access the network unless told to do so. That is, if no crates comes from crates.io, a git repository, or some other network location, Cargo will never attempt to make a network connection. As a result, if Cargo attempts to touch the network, then it's because it needs to fetch a required resource. Cargo is also quite aggressive about caching information to minimize the amount of network activity. It will guarantee, for example, that if cargo build (or an equivalent) is run to completion then the next cargo build is guaranteed to not touch the network so long as Cargo.toml has not been modified in the meantime. This avoidance of the network boils down to a Cargo.lock existing and a populated cache of the crates reflected in the lock file. If either of these components are missing, then they're required for the build to succeed and must be fetched remotely. As of Rust 1.11.0 Cargo understands a new flag, --frozen , which is an assertion that it shouldn't touch the network. When passed, Cargo will immediately return an error if it would otherwise attempt a network request. The error should include contextual information about why the network request is being made in the first place to help debug as well. Note that this flag does not change the behavior of Cargo , it simply asserts that Cargo shouldn't touch the network as a previous command has been run to ensure that network activity shouldn't be necessary.

Before we talk about them, here’s a summary: Cargo.toml is about describing your dependencies in a broad sense, and is written by you. Cargo.lock contains exact information about your dependencies. It is maintained by Cargo and should not be manually edited. If you’re building a library that other projects will depend on, put Cargo.lock in your .gitignore . If you’re building an executable like a command-line tool or an application, check Cargo.lock into git . If you're curious about why that is, see \"Why do binaries have Cargo.lock in version control, but not libraries?\" in the FAQ . Let’s dig in a little bit more. Cargo.toml is a manifest file in which we can specify a bunch of different metadata about our project. For example, we can say that we depend on another project: [package]\nname = \"hello_world\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"Your Name <you@example.com>\"] [dependencies]\nrand = { git = \"https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git\" } This project has a single dependency, on the rand library. We’ve stated in this case that we’re relying on a particular Git repository that lives on GitHub. Since we haven’t specified any other information, Cargo assumes that we intend to use the latest commit on the master branch to build our project. Sound good? Well, there’s one problem: If you build this project today, and then you send a copy to me, and I build this project tomorrow, something bad could happen. There could be more commits to rand in the meantime, and my build would include new commits while yours would not. Therefore, we would get different builds. This would be bad because we want reproducible builds. We could fix this problem by putting a rev line in our Cargo.toml : [dependencies]\nrand = { git = \"https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git\", rev = \"9f35b8e\" } Now our builds will be the same. But there’s a big drawback: now we have to manually think about SHA-1s every time we want to update our library. This is both tedious and error prone. Enter the Cargo.lock . Because of its existence, we don’t need to manually keep track of the exact revisions: Cargo will do it for us. When we have a manifest like this: [package]\nname = \"hello_world\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"Your Name <you@example.com>\"] [dependencies]\nrand = { git = \"https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git\" } Cargo will take the latest commit and write that information out into our Cargo.lock when we build for the first time. That file will look like this: [[package]]\nname = \"hello_world\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndependencies = [ \"rand 0.1.0 (git+https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git#9f35b8e439eeedd60b9414c58f389bdc6a3284f9)\",\n] [[package]]\nname = \"rand\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nsource = \"git+https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand.git#9f35b8e439eeedd60b9414c58f389bdc6a3284f9\" You can see that there’s a lot more information here, including the exact revision we used to build. Now when you give your project to someone else, they’ll use the exact same SHA, even though we didn’t specify it in our Cargo.toml . When we’re ready to opt in to a new version of the library, Cargo can re-calculate the dependencies and update things for us: $ cargo update # updates all dependencies\n$ cargo update -p rand # updates just “rand” This will write out a new Cargo.lock with the new version information. Note that the argument to cargo update is actually a Package ID Specification and rand is just a short specification.","title":"Cargo.toml vs Cargo.lock"},"reference/build-scripts.html#case-study-linking-to-system-libraries":{"breadcrumbs":"Cargo Reference » Case study: Linking to system libraries","title":"Case study: Linking to system libraries","body":"The final case study here will be investigating how a Cargo library links to a system library and how the build script is leveraged to support this use case. Quite frequently a Rust crate wants to link to a native library often provided on the system to bind its functionality or just use it as part of an implementation detail. This is quite a nuanced problem when it comes to performing this in a platform-agnostic fashion, and the purpose of a build script is again to farm out as much of this as possible to make this as easy as possible for consumers. As an example to follow, let’s take a look at one of Cargo’s own dependencies , libgit2 . The C library has a number of constraints: It has an optional dependency on OpenSSL on Unix to implement the https transport. It has an optional dependency on libssh2 on all platforms to implement the ssh transport. It is often not installed on all systems by default. It can be built from source using cmake . To visualize what’s going on here, let’s take a look at the manifest for the relevant Cargo package that links to the native C library.

The root crate 's Cargo.toml contains the [workspace] table, but is not required to have other configuration. Whenever any crate in the workspace is compiled, output is placed in the workspace root . i.e. next to the root crate 's Cargo.toml . The lock file for all crates in the workspace resides in the workspace root . The [patch] , [replace] and [profile.*] sections in Cargo.toml are only recognized in the root crate 's manifest, and ignored in member crates' manifests. The root crate of a workspace, indicated by the presence of [workspace] in its manifest, is responsible for defining the entire workspace. All path dependencies residing in the workspace directory become members. You can add additional packages to the workspace by listing them in the members key. Note that members of the workspaces listed explicitly will also have their path dependencies included in the workspace. Sometimes a project may have a lot of workspace members and it can be onerous to keep up to date. The path dependency can also use globs to match multiple paths. Finally, the exclude key can be used to blacklist paths from being included in a workspace. This can be useful if some path dependencies aren't desired to be in the workspace at all. The package.workspace manifest key (described above) is used in member crates to point at a workspace's root crate. If this key is omitted then it is inferred to be the first crate whose manifest contains [workspace] upwards in the filesystem. A crate may either specify package.workspace or specify [workspace] . That is, a crate cannot both be a root crate in a workspace (contain [workspace] ) and also be a member crate of another workspace (contain package.workspace ). Most of the time workspaces will not need to be dealt with as cargo new and cargo init will handle workspace configuration automatically. Virtual Manifest In workspace manifests, if the package table is present, the workspace root crate will be treated as a normal package, as well as a workspace. If the package table is not present in a workspace manifest, it is called a virtual manifest . Package selection In a workspace, package-related cargo commands like cargo build apply to packages selected by -p / --package or --all command-line parameters.

Just go to https://crates.io/login This is basically a catch-all for “you tried to query a team, and one of the five levels of membership access control denied this”. That is not an exaggeration. GitHub’s support for team access control is Enterprise Grade. The most likely cause of this is simply that you last logged in before this feature was added. We originally requested no permissions from GitHub when authenticating users, because we didn’t actually ever use the user’s token for anything other than logging them in. However to query team membership on your behalf, we now require the read:org scope . You are free to deny us this scope, and everything that worked before teams were introduced will keep working.

You can read about overriding dependencies in the overriding dependencies section of this documentation. Cargo supports the ability to replace one source with another to express strategies along the lines of mirrors or vendoring dependencies. Configuration is currently done through the .cargo/config configuration mechanism, like so: # The `source` table is where all keys related to source-replacement\n# are stored.\n[source] # Under the `source` table are a number of other tables whose keys are a\n# name for the relevant source. For example this section defines a new\n# source, called `my-awesome-source`, which comes from a directory\n# located at `vendor` relative to the directory containing this `.cargo/config`\n# file\n[source.my-awesome-source]\ndirectory = \"vendor\" # Git sources can optionally specify a branch/tag/rev as well\ngit = \"https://example.com/path/to/repo\"\n# branch = \"master\"\n# tag = \"v1.0.1\"\n# rev = \"313f44e8\" # The crates.io default source for crates is available under the name\n# \"crates-io\", and here we use the `replace-with` key to indicate that it's\n# replaced with our source above.\n[source.crates-io]\nreplace-with = \"my-awesome-source\" With this configuration Cargo attempts to look up all crates in the directory \"vendor\" rather than querying the online registry at crates.io. Using source replacement Cargo can express: Vendoring - custom sources can be defined which represent crates on the local filesystem. These sources are subsets of the source that they're replacing and can be checked into projects if necessary. Mirroring - sources can be replaced with an equivalent version which acts as a cache for crates.io itself. Cargo has a core assumption about source replacement that the source code is exactly the same from both sources. In our above example Cargo assumes that all of the crates coming from my-awesome-source are the exact same as the copies from crates-io . Note that this also means that my-awesome-source is not allowed to have crates which are not present in the crates-io source. As a consequence, source replacement is not appropriate for situations such as patching a dependency or a private registry. Cargo supports patching dependencies through the usage of the [replace] key , and private registry support is planned for a future version of Cargo.","breadcrumbs":"Cargo Reference » Source Replacement"},"faq.html#does-cargo-work-on-windows":{"id":"faq.html#does-cargo-work-on-windows","body":"Yes!

You are, however, quite enterprising so you decide to also try out to fix the bug! Originally your manifest will look like: uuid [package]\nname = \"my-library\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"...\"] [dependencies]\nuuid = \"1.0\" First thing we'll do is to clone the uuid repository locally via: $ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid Next we'll edit the manifest of my-library to contain: [patch.crates-io]\nuuid = { path = \"../path/to/uuid\" } Here we declare that we're patching the source crates-io with a new dependency. This will effectively add the local checked out version of uuid to the crates.io registry for our local project. Next up we need to ensure that our lock file is updated to use this new version of uuid so our project uses the locally checked out copy instead of one from crates.io. The way [patch] works is that it'll load the dependency at ../path/to/uuid and then whenever crates.io is queried for versions of uuid it'll also return the local version. This means that the version number of the local checkout is significant and will affect whether the patch is used. Our manifest declared uuid = \"1.0\" which means we'll only resolve to >= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0 , and Cargo's greedy resolution algorithm also means that we'll resolve to the maximum version within that range. Typically this doesn't matter as the version of the git repository will already be greater or match the maximum version published on crates.io, but it's important to keep this in mind! In any case, typically all you need to do now is: $ cargo build Compiling uuid v1.0.0 (file://.../uuid) Compiling my-library v0.1.0 (file://.../my-library) Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs And that's it! You're now building with the local version of uuid (note the file:// in the build output). If you don't see the file:// version getting built then you may need to run cargo update -p uuid --precise $version where $version is the version of the locally checked out copy of uuid . Once you've fixed the bug you originally found the next thing you'll want to do is to likely submit that as a pull request to the uuid crate itself. Once you've done this then you can also update the [patch] section. The listing inside of [patch] is just like the [dependencies] section, so once your pull request is merged you could change your path dependency to: [patch.crates-io]\nuuid = { git = 'https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/uuid' }"},"reference/publishing.html#before-publishing-a-new-crate":{"id":"reference/publishing.html#before-publishing-a-new-crate","breadcrumbs":"Cargo Reference » Before publishing a new crate","body":"Keep in mind that crate names on crates.io are allocated on a first-come-first- serve basis. Once a crate name is taken, it cannot be used for another crate. Packaging a crate The next step is to package up your crate into a format that can be uploaded to crates.io . For this we’ll use the cargo package subcommand. This will take our entire crate and package it all up into a *.crate file in the target/package directory. $ cargo package As an added bonus, the *.crate will be verified independently of the current source tree. After the *.crate is created, it’s unpacked into target/package and then built from scratch to ensure that all necessary files are there for the build to succeed. This behavior can be disabled with the --no-verify flag. Now’s a good time to take a look at the *.crate file to make sure you didn’t accidentally package up that 2GB video asset, or large data files used for code generation, integration tests, or benchmarking. There is currently a 10MB upload size limit on *.crate files.

For this use case Cargo offers a much more limited version of overrides called path overrides . Path overrides are specified through .cargo/config instead of Cargo.toml , and you can find more documentation about this configuration . Inside of .cargo/config you'll specify a key called paths : paths = [\"/path/to/uuid\"] This array should be filled with directories that contain a Cargo.toml . In this instance, we’re just adding uuid , so it will be the only one that’s overridden. This path can be either absolute or relative to the directory that contains the .cargo folder. Path overrides are more restricted than the [patch] section, however, in that they cannot change the structure of the dependency graph. When a path replacement is used then the previous set of dependencies must all match exactly to the new Cargo.toml specification. For example this means that path overrides cannot be used to test out adding a dependency to a crate, instead [patch] must be used in that situation. As a result usage of a path override is typically isolated to quick bug fixes rather than larger changes.

It is then used to provide deterministic builds across whatever machine is building the project by ensuring that the exact same dependencies are being compiled. This property is most desirable from applications and projects which are at the very end of the dependency chain (binaries). As a result, it is recommended that all binaries check in their Cargo.lock . For libraries the situation is somewhat different. A library is not only used by the library developers, but also any downstream consumers of the library. Users dependent on the library will not inspect the library’s Cargo.lock (even if it exists). This is precisely because a library should not be deterministically recompiled for all users of the library. If a library ends up being used transitively by several dependencies, it’s likely that just a single copy of the library is desired (based on semver compatibility). If all libraries were to check in their Cargo.lock , then multiple copies of the library would be used, and perhaps even a version conflict. In other words, libraries specify semver requirements for their dependencies but cannot see the full picture.

For this, there are a few subcommands to manage a crate. cargo yank Occasions may arise where you publish a version of a crate that actually ends up being broken for one reason or another (syntax error, forgot to include a file, etc.). For situations such as this, Cargo supports a “yank” of a version of a crate. $ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1\n$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo A yank does not delete any code. This feature is not intended for deleting accidentally uploaded secrets, for example. If that happens, you must reset those secrets immediately. The semantics of a yanked version are that no new dependencies can be created against that version, but all existing dependencies continue to work. One of the major goals of crates.io is to act as a permanent archive of crates that does not change over time, and allowing deletion of a version would go against this goal. Essentially a yank means that all projects with a Cargo.lock will not break, while any future Cargo.lock files generated will not list the yanked version. cargo owner A crate is often developed by more than one person, or the primary maintainer may change over time! The owner of a crate is the only person allowed to publish new versions of the crate, but an owner may designate additional owners. $ cargo owner --add my-buddy\n$ cargo owner --remove my-buddy\n$ cargo owner --add github:rust-lang:owners\n$ cargo owner --remove github:rust-lang:owners The owner IDs given to these commands must be GitHub user names or GitHub teams. If a user name is given to --add , that user becomes a “named” owner, with full rights to the crate. In addition to being able to publish or yank versions of the crate, they have the ability to add or remove owners, including the owner that made them an owner. Needless to say, you shouldn’t make people you don’t fully trust into a named owner. In order to become a named owner, a user must have logged into crates.io previously. If a team name is given to --add , that team becomes a “team” owner, with restricted right to the crate. While they have permission to publish or yank versions of the crate, they do not have the ability to add or remove owners. In addition to being more convenient for managing groups of owners, teams are just a bit more secure against owners becoming malicious.

Once you’re ready for release, you can use cargo build --release to compile your files with optimizations turned on: $ cargo build --release Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (file:///path/to/project/hello_world) cargo build --release puts the resulting binary in target/release instead of target/debug .

A feature of a package is either an optional dependency, or a set of other features. The format for specifying features is: [package]\nname = \"awesome\" [features]\n# The default set of optional packages. Most people will want to use these\n# packages, but they are strictly optional. Note that `session` is not a package\n# but rather another feature listed in this manifest.\ndefault = [\"jquery\", \"uglifier\", \"session\"] # A feature with no dependencies is used mainly for conditional compilation,\n# like `#[cfg(feature = \"go-faster\")]`.\ngo-faster = [] # The `secure-password` feature depends on the bcrypt package. This aliasing\n# will allow people to talk about the feature in a higher-level way and allow\n# this package to add more requirements to the feature in the future.\nsecure-password = [\"bcrypt\"] # Features can be used to reexport features of other packages. The `session`\n# feature of package `awesome` will ensure that the `session` feature of the\n# package `cookie` is also enabled.\nsession = [\"cookie/session\"] [dependencies]\n# These packages are mandatory and form the core of this package’s distribution.\ncookie = \"1.2.0\"\noauth = \"1.1.0\"\nroute-recognizer = \"=2.1.0\" # A list of all of the optional dependencies, some of which are included in the\n# above `features`. They can be opted into by apps.\njquery = { version = \"1.0.2\", optional = true }\nuglifier = { version = \"1.5.3\", optional = true }\nbcrypt = { version = \"*\", optional = true }\ncivet = { version = \"*\", optional = true } To use the package awesome : [dependencies.awesome]\nversion = \"1.3.5\"\ndefault-features = false # do not include the default features, and optionally # cherry-pick individual features\nfeatures = [\"secure-password\", \"civet\"] Rules The usage of features is subject to a few rules: Feature names must not conflict with other package names in the manifest. This is because they are opted into via features = [...] , which only has a single namespace. With the exception of the default feature, all features are opt-in. To opt out of the default feature, use default-features = false and cherry-pick individual features. Feature groups are not allowed to cyclically depend on one another. Dev-dependencies cannot be optional. Features groups can only reference optional dependencies. When a feature is selected, Cargo will call rustc with --cfg feature=\"${feature_name}\" . If a feature group is included, it and all of its individual features will be included. This can be tested in code via #[cfg(feature = \"foo\")] . Note that it is explicitly allowed for features to not actually activate any optional dependencies. This allows packages to internally enable/disable features without requiring a new dependency. Usage in end products One major use-case for this feature is specifying optional features in end-products. For example, the Servo project may want to include optional features that people can enable or disable when they build it. In that case, Servo will describe features in its Cargo.toml and they can be enabled using command-line flags: $ cargo build --release --features \"shumway pdf\" Default features could be excluded using --no-default-features . Usage in packages In most cases, the concept of optional dependency in a library is best expressed as a separate package that the top-level application depends on. However, high-level packages, like Iron or Piston, may want the ability to curate a number of packages for easy installation. The current Cargo system allows them to curate a number of mandatory dependencies into a single package for easy installation. In some cases, packages may want to provide additional curation for optional dependencies: grouping a number of low-level optional dependencies together into a single high-level feature; specifying packages that are recommended (or suggested) to be included by users of the package; and including a feature (like secure-password in the motivating example) that will only work if an optional dependency is available, and would be difficult to implement as a separate package (for example, it may be overly difficult to design an IO package to be completely decoupled from OpenSSL, with opt-in via the inclusion of a separate package). In almost all cases, it is an antipattern to use these features outside of high-level packages that are designed for curation. If a feature is optional, it can almost certainly be expressed as a separate package."},"reference/specifying-dependencies.html#build-dependencies":{"body":"You can depend on other Cargo-based crates for use in your build scripts. Dependencies are declared through the build-dependencies section of the manifest: [build-dependencies]\ncc = \"1.0.3\" The build script does not have access to the dependencies listed in the dependencies or dev-dependencies section. Build dependencies will likewise not be available to the package itself unless listed under the dependencies section as well.
